The School of Humanities and Sciences (H&S) is the foundation of a liberal arts education at Stanford. The school encompasses 24 departments and 25 interdisciplinary programs. H&S is home to fundamental and applied research, where free, open, and critical inquiry is pursued across disciplines. As the university’s largest school, H&S serves as the foundation of a Stanford undergraduate education no matter which discipline students pursue as a major. Graduate students work alongside world-renowned faculty to pursue and shape foundational research that leads to breakthroughs and discoveries that shed new light on the past, influence the present, and shape the future. Together, faculty and students in H&S engage in inspirational teaching, learning, and research every day.


**Position Summary:**



Stanfordʼs School of Humanities and Sciences Information Technology team (H&S IT) is seeking an **Organizational Insight Analyst.** This is a newly created position on our team, which will play an instrumental role in bolstering our strategic objectives. The incumbent will perform in-depth analysis, typically focused on vexing problems and complex processes. The analysis will support data-driven decision-making, which will contribute to our ability to transform H&S IT processes, systems, and services. Some analysis will be quantitative, requiring data gathering from disparate data sources, normalizing and joining the data, performing statistical operations, finding patterns and anomalies, and telling a compelling story through visualizations and numeric/statistical reports. Other analysis will be qualitative, requiring synthesis of unstructured textual information from various sources such as policy documents, workflow documents, and business process guides, and telling a compelling story through narrative. The incumbent will also manage a select set of IT service management operations and processes.



H&S IT is part of the H&S Deanʼs Oﬀice (HSDO). We support the mission and operations of the School of Humanities and Sciences by developing and supporting IT processes, applications, and systems. H&S IT consists of three-sub teams: H&S IT Application Services which supports applications and data systems; H&S IT Web Services which supports web content management systems and digital accessibility eﬀorts; and H&S IT Operations which supports other technology services and processes that keep our schoolʼs everyday IT running smoothly. The Organizational Insight Analyst works on the H&S IT Operations team and reports directly to the H&S Chief Information Oﬀicer.



Stanford has a highly decentralized IT organizational structure. In some cases H&S IT wholly owns and supports IT systems specific to the School of Humanities and Sciences. In other cases H&S IT provides local support to H&S for the IT systems/projects that are owned by other campus IT organizations. And in other cases yet, H&S IT is far removed from the technology support processes but we advocate for H&S users and we reduce friction by getting them to the right place to get their needs met quickly. The Stanford technology stacks are equally complex, with an expanse of applications, systems, databases, integrations, and processes. Itʼs up to H&S IT to determine how/where we can leverage those systems individually and collectively to meet H&S needs. The Organizational Insight Analyst will contribute to these eﬀorts.



This is 100% FTE, continuing, exempt position. H&S IT is a remote work team that maintains core business hours during Pacific Time. All team members are required to convene together tri-annually on Stanfordʼs historic campus for 3-5 days to perform in-person planning and collaboration activities.


**How to Apply:**



If you believe that this opportunity is a match for your knowledge, skills and abilities, we invite you to apply for this position by clicking on the “Apply for Job” button. To be considered, please submit an online application and include a cover letter, résumé, and (optionally) a link to your online portfolio of work samples if available.

* Answer questions by developing research methodology, gathering data and/or using appropriate statistical techniques on available data.

Since 2017, over 1 million people have gotten “On The Path” with us and, by doing so, have reversed pain, renewed energy, and aged more gracefully.

  

We provide a rewarding, collaborative, and exciting work environment that focuses on personal growth, with weekly company-wide culture calls hosted by our leaders designed to foster team spirit, encourage movement, and build our community. In 2023, the entire company was flown to a ranch in Tucson, AZ, for team-building activities and had a blast while doing it!

* Attention to Detail: You have an eye for editing and revising until something is near perfect, and make sure that nothing falls through the cracks. You are organized and can stay on top of multiple projects at the same time.
* Research Experience: If you don’t know something, you take initiative to get the information you need! You can sift through different avenues until you find what you are looking for, can dig deep and read between the lines.


Bonus Points:* Bachelor’s Degree or 2+ years of equivalent work experience
* Talent Systems experience/familiarity: We use Workday (ATS), Avature (CRM), LinkedIn, Seekout, and other smaller talent systems in our day to day work.

The experience acquired in one of these early career roles can lay the groundwork for future success in frontline fundraising, planned giving work, more advanced analytical roles, or in fundraising operations administration. UDAR at UCSF offers some of the most competitive salaries in the entire University of California system, equity-based pay, a flexible hybrid-remote work environment, mentorship/extended learning opportunities, and staff engagement opportunities, including through our Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, Accessibility (DEIA+) work.  

  

The Gift & Endowment Planning (GEP) team is looking for a Development Analyst who meets the above criteria and who also has an interest in planned giving. The GEP Team plays an integral role in UDAR’s fundraising efforts, serving as in-house representative in planned giving (gifts donors make through their wills or various other gift vehicles); advising prospects, donors and UDAR staff; drafting gift agreements; administering bequests from trusts and estates; and allocating bequests within UCSF. In short, GEP serves as a resource in all aspects of gift planning for donors, prospects, staff and outside professionals and provides information, advice and strategies for planned gifts as part of the solicitation and stewardship of those gifts, as well as the UCSF portion of the administration of trust and estate gifts. Over half of our team members have a law degree, therefore interested applicants with a legal background might find this opportunity a unique way to utilize a similar skill set.  

  

A successful hire will play a key role in GEP team’s efforts to solicit, secure and steward planned gifts for UCSF as well as supporting UDAR’s major gift fundraising efforts. The GEP analyst position calls for acumen, awareness, and diplomacy; understanding of the relationship-building strategies involved in securing both planned gifts and major gifts; and talent in managing project work in support of these efforts. Under the direction of the GEP Executive Director, this role will manage and triage workflow supporting GEP’s frontline staff so that they are optimizing time devising and implementing gift strategies, soliciting, securing, and stewarding planned gifts, efficiently administering Estates Under Administration, and partnering with UDAR fundraisers and UCSF campus colleagues to secure major gifts for UCSF.  

  

In the first month, you will familiarize yourself with the work of the Gift & Endowment Planning team, and you will learn about the patient care, research, education, and public service missions of UCSF while attaining a basic working knowledge of UDAR and UCSF systems such as our donor database and the systems and technology that support our day-to-day work.  

  

In the first three months, you will have a sense of GEP’s workflow, you will familiarize yourself with UDAR’s Salesforce database with special attention to GEP’s work ensuring that planned gifts are correctly allocated, and that donor activity is accurately recorded.  

  

In the first six months, you will have seamlessly integrated yourself into the GEP team and will be making daily contributions to our productivity, for example, by providing team members with sought after data from the database, accurately & efficiently triaging donor inquiries, and proactively addressing issues that arise which impede GEP’s productivity.  

  

At the end of your the first year, you will have developed relationships with colleagues across UDAR, you will be doing your day-to-day work with minimal guidance from others and will be a resource both for colleagues within the GEP team and in UDAR. You will be providing key reporting and logistical support in areas such as estate administration and donor stewardship that will translate directly to new gifts as well as increased donor & prospect activity across GEP. **To see the salary range for this position (we recommend that you make a note of the job code and use that to look up):** TCS Non-Academic Titles Search (ucop.edu)
