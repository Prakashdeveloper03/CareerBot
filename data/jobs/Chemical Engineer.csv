**ABOUT US:**  


The **VERBIO Nevada Biorefinery**, located in Nevada, Iowa (USA), is the first industrial scale renewable natural gas (RNG) facility in North America using agricultural residues as its feedstock. The plant is 100% owned by VERBIO North America Holdings Corporation.
RNG production from corn stover began in December 2021 with the completion of Phase I, at a capacity of 7 million ethanol gallons equivalent (EGE) per year. Upon completion of Phase II in the 4th quarter of 2022, the site will begin operating as a biorefinery, producing 60 million gallons of corn-based ethanol and an additional 19 million (EGE) of RNG from stillage. The integration of RNG and ethanol production, unique to VERBIO, incorporates advanced operational technology currently practiced at the company’s facilities in Germany. The process also yields humus, a soil amendment, and organic fertilizers.  


**VERBIO Vereinigte BioEnergie AG (VERBIO AG)**, with headquarters in Leipzig, Germany, is a leading independent manufacturer of biofuels and bioenergy in Germany and Europe. The company began producing biofuel in 2001 and today has approximately 900 employees at its locations in Germany, Poland, Hungary, India, USA and Canada producing biodiesel, bioethanol and biomethane (renewable natural gas), as well as feed, bio-fertilizers and other high-value by-products for the nutrition, pharmaceutical and cosmetics industries, all on an industrial scale. VERBIO concentrates on the use of internally developed innovative and efficient energy-saving production processes. With its innovative processes and highly efficient production plants, VERBIO is a technology leader in the biofuels market.
In January 2018, VERBIO AG formed its US subsidiary, VERBIO North America (VNA), with headquarters in Livonia, Michigan, USA. VNA plans to build, own, operate, and finance biofuel facilities across the United States and Canada.

**Who you are:**



A startup person: You aren't driven by titles or hierarchy, and prefer efficiency to excess process. You don't need or expect to have a lot of guidance but you enjoy working in a fast-paced team.

There is plenty of important work and plenty of good opportunities with organizations like that.



Motivated: You are self-motivated. You bring an enthusiasm to the team, and imbue a sense of passion that goes beyond clocking in and clocking out. This isn't about a fake or arbitrary ""pieces of flair"" mentality or lack of work-life balance! It is about being a part of the vision and feeling a part of reaching team goals.



A team-player: Oklo genuinely is a team. We aren't about taking credit for ourselves, and we aren't about pushing blame to others. We do incredible things because we work as a team.



An excellent communicator: We need a person who is not only technically competent but also a clear and upbeat communicator.



Creative: Being creative means that when things fall outside clear scopes or processes or problems arise without clear solutions, you are able to identify it as well as invent ways to solve a problem or fill a need without micromanagement. The successful person in this job will not only be creative, but also enjoy being creative and solving open-ended problems which may change day-by-day.



Detail-oriented: This focus is a big part of excellence, consistency, and quality. Excellent grammar and spelling matter for both good communication as well as the image of the company that we put forward.

Salary: $75,000-$170,000
