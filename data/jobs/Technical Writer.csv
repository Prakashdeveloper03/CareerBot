We’ve built a global workforce of outstanding team members and a flexible culture built on trust, collaboration, and belonging.** ***This position can be located in Toronto, ON, Canada, Seattle, WA, USA, or remote within a North American time zone*** **About the Role**
Technical Writers contribute to the development and production of Help content, UI text, API documentation, integration and setup guides, training materials, and knowledge base articles in support of all WatchGuard products. We work collaboratively and closely with software engineers, UX designers, product owners, program managers, trainers, and the technical support team to deliver documentation that helps customers use WatchGuard’s cloud-based SaaS products and hardware devices. **The Team**
As a full-time Senior Technical Writer at WatchGuard, you'll join a distributed team of dedicated writers and trainers based in Seattle, Toronto, Bilbao, Noida, and remote locations.

We thrive in a fast-paced environment and know that our work is highly valued by our colleagues and customers and has a real impact in the world. The content we create helps our customers protect their users, data, and networks from attack and respond to breaking threats such as ransomware, viruses, and malware. WatchGuard understands the importance of high-quality technical documentation and the WatchGuard Help Center receives thousands of page views every day. **About You**
You’re an experienced Technical Writer who is passionate about writing content that helps readers solve real-world problems. You’ve worked closely with Agile development teams and UX designers, and thrive in a fast-paced environment where your documentation is key to customer’s success. You’re familiar with tracking software such as Jira, effectively manage your own work, and can balance priorities across multiple projects.
You love to get hands on with complex technology and figure out how it works, and you’re relentless in tracking down the information your readers need to know. You become an expert in the products and feature areas you document and know the best way to explain them to your readers.
You enjoy collaboration, giving and getting feedback, and working in a supportive team setting. Although you have a favorite Style Guide, you can adapt your writing to new rules, and different audiences.
You have experience reviewing and editing other writer’s content, and providing guidance on grammar, style, structure, and tone. You get excited by content architecture challenges where platform features might impact multiple sets of product documentation, and work well with teammates to find solutions.
You’re comfortable working with cross-functional teams, advocating for your readers in meetings and demos, and can drive complex documentation projects to completion with minimal supervision. You love to learn, share your knowledge, and mentor newer writers.  

  

**A Day in the Life of a Technical Writer at WatchGuard**
No day as a WatchGuard Technical Writer is the same. We juggle short and long-term projects with competing deadlines, and manage a backlog of documentation tasks in Jira.

To start your day, you could write an article to explain a breaking issue or attend a sprint demo or grooming session. You might log in to WatchGuard Cloud to explore new functionality that will release next week, or install new software in our Writer’s lab. Next, you jump on a call to discuss a new feature with engineers and the product owner so you can start to write online Help content in Flare.

Later, you could collaborate with other writers on improvements to WatchGuard Help Center or review a UX design for an upcoming feature. Then, you’ll refine your Help topics in preparation for our weekly Help Center update, check files into source control and update Jira tasks for the work you completed.
### **Your First Week**

* We’ll help you get settled in and introduce you to the tools you’ll use to create documentation at WatchGuard, such as Madcap Flare, Jira, Confluence, and Perforce.
* You’ll start to learn about the different WatchGuard products and the content we create.
* You’ll familiarize yourself with the WatchGuard Style Guide and do some copy editing or make updates to existing Help or KB documentation.

### **Your First Month**

* You’ll complete training on WatchGuard products and start to contribute content to our weekly Help Center builds to document new or updated features.
* You’ll review and copy edit Integration Guides, edit and publish KB articles, and work on Release Notes and What’s New content.
* You’ll work closely with another writer to review a UX design for an upcoming feature and suggest text improvements in Figma.

### **Your First Year**

* After a year, you completely own the documentation for a product or feature area and keep it up to date when we release new software updates.
* You copy edit and provide developmental feedback on other writers’ work and help them to follow our Style Guide rules and best practices.
* You lead complex documentation projects, drive improvements to our documentation processes and tools, and help to shape the direction of our documentation deliverables.

**Compensation**
The base salary range for this position is $80,000 - $105,000 USD per year, exclusive of benefits. This position is also eligible for a bonus of 5% of the base salary. Your base salary compensation will be based on your individual skills, education, and experience. Please keep in mind that the above range is the full base salary range for this role; hiring at the maximum of the range is not typical in order to allow for future salary growth.

We're looking for a Technical Editor to join our editorial team. Knowledge of any of our other primary verticals (health, SaaS, project management, and finance) would also be an asset.

  



The role is freelance to start, but we’re a fast-moving, rapidly growing company, so there’s lots of opportunity for growth if you excel.

 **Who you are:**

If small adjustments need to be made to improve flow or fix something factually incorrect, you'll make the change yourself.



You'll be providing valuable feedback to writers, both to improve them for the future and to ensure they understand what needs to be fixed (if necessary).



You'll be working with a team of other editors to complete content to a high quality standard against a client-specific style guide.



We'll pay you well based on your experience, and you'll be working with some of the sharpest content marketing minds in the industry. You'll be expected to learn quickly and ask questions once.



If that sounds like something you're interested in, send us your resume, as well as a cover letter explaining why you're right for the job."
