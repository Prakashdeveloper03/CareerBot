**What’s the story?** 

In India, there are more than 453+ million migrants. Less than 2% of this cohort uses mobile payments to send money home. While penetration of UPI and digital banking hit the ceiling, this invisible workforce that powers most of Bharat is still stuck in a cash economy and remains underbanked. **branchX is India's first neobank enabling empathetic banking for migrant communities.** Building banking that is meaningfully accessible to every aspiring Indian goes beyond the 9-5 bustle. If you are someone who derives fulfillment from purpose-led work with the ability to experiment, innovate, fail and iterate, branchX is the playground for you.

**About Us:**

Launched in June 2020, branchX is India's first neo-banking solution, enabling empathetic banking for migrant communities. Our vision is to transform the way underbanked communities manage money with a ‘hand-holding grid’ aided by intelligent technologies.

* Knowledge of multiple front-end languages and libraries (e.g. HTML/ CSS, JavaScript, XML, jQuery)
* Knowledge of multiple back-end languages (e.g. C#, Java, Python) and JavaScript frameworks (e.g. Angular, React, Node.js)
* Familiarity with databases (e.g. MySQL, MongoDB), web servers (e.g. Apache), and UI/UX design
* Excellent communication and teamwork skills.
* Organizational skills
* Degree in Computer Science, Statistics or a relevant field.

**What expertise & experiences would you need to have to play this kind of role?**

**Core Value** 

‘Empathy’ as a term has become a buzzword. At branchX, we are constantly reimagining what empathy means in action. While we are finding new ways of translating empathy at work and on the ground, we do know that it goes beyond the extension of feeling 'something' for an individual. We are combining empathy and action to uplift underbanked communities. What does this mean for you? It means you’ll be part of co-creating products for the masses. Products that are meaningfully accessed by the underserved and will directly boost India’s economy in the long term. If indulging in blue-sky thinking, innovating, and iterating to create grassroots impact makes you tickle.
