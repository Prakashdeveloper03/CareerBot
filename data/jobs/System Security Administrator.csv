Dew Wealth Management is a Fiduciary Investment Advisory Firm that provides “Virtual Family Office” wealth management services to entrepreneurs through a model that is disrupting the investment advisory industry. Our visionary model and elite team of highly entrepreneurial advisors has resulted in an aggressive growth trajectory that Inc.

If you love being challenged by complex problems and are hungry for an opportunity to rapidly advance your skillset and career, Dew Wealth Management offers a collaborative and supportive culture that will invest in your professional development in equal measure to your investments in our clients’ success.

**About the Position**

If you’re looking for an opportunity to build out the nascent IT Department of an Inc. 5000 rapidly-growing organization, taking senior responsibility, not just for systems administration, but also for driving new initiatives designed to scale our IT infrastructure as this company grows from 34 employees to 100+ over the next few years, our IT Administrator (aka System Administrator) role may be for you.

Reporting directly to our , you will be the first full-time IT hire into this company, responsible for helping us reduce our independence on our outsourced IT vendor while also up-leveling (a) the technical support we can give our growing team of remote employees, and (b) the sophistication and scalability of our IT infrastructure. It’s an opportunity to play a pivotal role in building out the IT infrastructure of a rapidly growing company as it scales.

This is not an entry-level role. We’re looking for someone with significant experience in Office 365 network administration to come alongside us to up-level our IT architecture in a way that will help this company scale efficiently and securely. An ideal applicant would, therefore, have a degree in computer science, systems engineering, or network administration, as well as a Microsoft 365 Certification as a “Teams Administrator Associate” with an “Administrator Expert” certification being preferred. With that said, we understand that many of the most talented IT professionals took career paths that didn’t go through traditional educational institutions, nor have they prioritized chasing Microsoft certification to validate skills they have acquired through experience. So, if it’s possible for you to quickly get the aforementioned Microsoft Certifications, that would enhance your application. But we will give all applicants an opportunity to demonstrate their skills and experience throughout this process, even if they don’t check all the rigid academic and certification boxes that would be ideal.

Notwithstanding the virtual nature of our model, at present, we are only hiring applicants who reside within the continental United States (excluding CA) to minimize HR and tax complexities and to keep our team within four time zones of each other.

**Key Responsibilities**

Provide administrative and technical support for all IT assets within our diverse tech stack.

* Serve as the primary administrator of all assets within our diverse tech stack.
* Creating user accounts, performing access control, and assist colleagues with issues as they arise.

**Life at Abridge**
-------------------


At Abridge, we’re driven by our mission to bring understanding and follow-through to every medical conversation. Our culture is founded on doing things the “inverse” way in a legacy system—focusing on patients, instead of the system; focusing on outcomes, instead of billing; and focusing on the end-user experience, instead of a hospital administrator's mandate.


Abridgers are engineers, scientists, designers, and health policy experts from a diverse set of backgrounds—an experiment in alchemy that helps us transform an industry dominated by EHRs and enterprise into a consumer-driven experience, one recording at a time. We believe in strong ideas, loosely held, and place a high premium on a growth mindset. We push each other to grow and expose each other to the latest in our respective fields. Whether it’s holding a PhD-level deep dive into understanding fairness and underlying bias in machine learning models, debating the merits of a Scandinavian design philosophy in our UI/UX, or writing responses for Medicare rules to influence U.S. health policy, we prioritize sharing our findings across the team and helping each other be successful.

**Diversity & Inclusion**
-------------------------


Abridge is an equal opportunity employer. Diversity and inclusion is at the core of what we do. We actively welcome applicants from all backgrounds (including but not limited to race, gender, educational background, and sexual orientation).

IBM zERT Network Analyzer is a web-based graphical user interface that z/OS network security administrators can use to analyze and report on data reported in zERT Summary records.  

  

z/OS V2R3 Communications Server introduced a new feature called z/OS Encryption Readiness Technology (zERT). zERT positions the TCP/IP stack to act as a focal point for collecting and reporting the cryptographic security attributes of IPv4 and IPv6 TCP and Enterprise Extender (EE) connection traffic that is protected using the TLS/SSL, SSH and IPSec cryptographic network security protocols. Connection data is written to z/OS System Management Facility (SMF) in two new SMF type 119 records:  

  

zERT Connection Detail (subtype 11) records are written on a per-connection basis to record the cryptographic protection history of a given TCP or EE connection.  

zERT Summary (subtype 12) records are written on a per-security-session basis at the end of each SMF interval to summarize the repeated use of security sessions during the interval.
