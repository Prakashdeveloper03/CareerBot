Your Role and Responsibilities  

**Who you are:**  

We are IBM ZOS (Z Operating System) - IBM Z Network Configuration Assistant Product team working on Z Enterprise Systems and we build the most secure systems for our Banking and Enterprise customers to deploy their mission critical applications. Also, We provide atmost security and Data management on Z systems. The mission critical applications run on zOS and The IBM® Configuration Assistant for z/OS® Communications Server, an optional GUI-based tool, provides a guided interface for configuring TCP/IP policy-based networking functions. You can use the IBM Configuration Assistant for z/OS Communications Server to generate the Policy Agent files.  

  

The IBM Configuration Assistant for z/OS Communications Server is a z/OS Management Facility (z/OSMF) task. z/OSMF provides a web browser interface for a variety of z/OS system management functions. When you invoke the IBM Configuration Assistant for z/OS Communications Server in z/OSMF, the IBM Configuration Assistant for z/OS Communications Server runs natively in the z/OS system and you can access it through a web browser.  

  

Through a series of wizards and online help panels, you can use the IBM Configuration Assistant for z/OS Communications Server to create AT-TLS configuration files for any number of z/OS images with any number of TCP/IP stacks per image. Using the IBM Configuration Assistant for z/OS Communications Server, there are three types of reusable objects:  

  

Traffic descriptors that define the local application, by describing the TCP traffic with ports or identifying the application using its jobname.  

Security levels that define the different ways to protect data, such as the encryption level.  

Requirement maps that map traffic descriptors to security levels. A single requirement map should contain a complete set of security requirements that will govern the level of security for multiple IP traffic types.  

  

For each TCP/IP stack, you create a set of connectivity rules that indicate the data endpoints and indicate which requirement map will govern security between the data endpoints.  

  

The IBM Configuration Assistant for z/OS Communications Server comes with a number of IBM-supplied traffic descriptors, security levels, and requirement maps that are easily applied, or you can use the IBM-supplied definitions as the basis for your own set of reusable objects.  

  

The IBM Configuration Assistant for z/OS Communications Server can dramatically reduce the amount of time that is required to create AT-TLS policy files, contributing to ease of configuration and maintenance. Because of the inherently complex nature of z/OS security, using the GUI can help you ensure that you have a consistent and easily manageable interface for implementing AT-TLS security.  

  

**What you’ll do:**
