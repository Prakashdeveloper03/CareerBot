We redefine what an earplug should sound, look and feel like. Whether it's hearing protection or comfort for your ears, Loop enables you to live life at your volume. Our founders Maarten and Dimitri started Loop back with a big idea. And a chronic ringing in their ears. Since then, we've helped more than 3,500,000 customers around the world to find quiet, enjoy great experiences and keep unwanted noise at bay.  

In 2023 we grew from almost 100 Loopers to over 250 people. And that's a number we would have to keep updating every month, as we are planning to double the team once again, this year.



Our headquarters are based in Antwerp, but with hubs in Amsterdam, Shanghai, and New York, we're dotted all over the globe.



Not to brag about it, but we've recently won the EY Scale up of the year award, the Deloitte Fast50 award (for the second year in a row) and a couple of other amazing (international) prices. The New York Times named us 'best earplugs for concerts' and thousands of noise-sensitive customers call us a 'life changer'.
