Nearly every company in the world runs on custom software: Gartner estimates that up to 50% of all code is written for internal use. This is the operational software for refunding orders, underwriting loans, onboarding employees, analyzing transactions, and providing customer support. But most companies don't have adequate resources to properly invest in these tools, leading to a lot of old and clunky internal software or, even worse, users still stuck in manual and spreadsheet flows.



At Retool, we're on a mission to bring good software to everyone. We're building a new type of development platform that combines the benefits of traditional software development with a drag-and-drop UI editor and AI, making it dramatically faster to build internal tools. We believe that the future of software development lies in abstracting away the tedious and repetitive tasks developers waste time on, while creating reusable components that act as a force multiplier for future developers and projects. The result is not just productivity, but good software by default. And that's a mission worth striving for.



Today, our customers span from small startups building their first operational tools to Fortune 500 companies building mission-critical apps for thousands of users across their business. Interested in joining us? Let us know!


**WHY WE'RE LOOKING FOR YOU:**



Our sales engineering team is critical to Retool. Sales Engineers drive revenue by partnering closely with potential customers and ensuring they're successful with Retool. A large portion of the Retool sales process is technical, ensuring potential customers understand how to build internal apps with Retool, deploy on their infrastructure, and connect to their critical resources. Building successful relationships with our customers is a key component of this role and you'll leverage your engineering background to dive in. Our revenue and business goals this year are aggressive, and we need the right team to help turn prospects into happy Retool customers.


**WHAT YOU'LL DO:**



Your workday will never be boring. You'll dive deep with prospects to understand their technical environment and their business goals. You'll create and deliver demos, build apps within Retool with prospects, answer technical questions, and manage the technical close throughout the sales cycle. At this stage in Retool's journey, we'll also look to you to help build new processes and programs to help our sales team meet and exceed quota.


**WHO YOU'LL WORK WITH:**



You'll join our team of Enterprise Sales Engineers and partner closely with our Enterprise Account Executives. You'll also work cross-functionally with the rest of the go-to-market team. You'll be joining a broader team of Retools who are passionate about serving our customers, enjoy collaborating to build an incredibly innovative product, and partake in some occasional but well-intentioned sarcasm. If this sounds like you, we'd love to hear from you!


### **IN THIS ROLE, YOU'LL:**


* Talk with potential customers, understand their problems, and assess whether or not Retool is a good fit
* Identify relevant stakeholders, budgets, timelines, etc. and manage the entire sales process
* Demo the Retool product, answer questions about Retool, ultimately convincing them Retool is the correct solution
* Create technical content to demonstrate best practices (e.g. sample apps, documentation, videos, etc.)
* Suss out the blockers for a customer in adopting Retool, and overcome them
* Dive into our codebase to understand technical limitations in Retool that need solving via code (e.g. a bug, a missing feature, etc.) to close a deal
* Serve as the primary, ongoing technical point of contact for our users in the presales process
* Answer technical questions from our customers as they come up

### **THE SKILLSET YOU'll BRING:**


* Experience working in the presales phase with large Enterprise customers

* Strong knowledge of SQL, various no-SQL databases, APIs, etc.

This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Retool and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors such as (but not limited to), scope and responsibilities, the candidate's experience and qualifications, and location.

Pearl Health is restoring the independence and joy of practicing medicine for doctors in the United States. Our healthcare system has burdened our doctors with too much process, while removing them from what they do best: caring for those we love most. We are a team of physicians and public health experts (Stanford, Dartmouth, Harvard, Mass. General), technologists (athenahealth, Apple, Amazon, Meta, Flatiron, WalMart Health), healthcare innovators (Oscar, Aledade, VillageMD, Stellar, Arcadia) and experienced risk management professionals (CVS/Aetna, Humana, Cigna, United, Bridgewater) who believe that primary care providers (PCPs) are the key to the United States' future health. Pearl recently announced a strategic partnership to proliferate value-based care with Walgreens, one of the largest healthcare companies in the country. Our investors include Andreessen Horowitz, Viking Global Investors, AlleyCorp, and SV Angel.



Pearl Health helps PCPs who are overwhelmed by the demands of an aging population and the unpredictable business model inherent to Medicare. Over time, this solution will empower PCPs to provide better care to the country. We believe there is a need to bring humanism back to healthcare by giving physicians the ability to better allocate their time with patients, increasing their autonomy, creating incentives that are aligned with achieving better outcomes through clinical decision-making powered by actionable intelligence, and making risk more available and more readily optimized through an intelligent marketplace.


**The role. . .**



Our Enterprise Sales Associates accelerate the expansion of our provider network, focused on generating qualified opportunities in designated markets that convert into Participating Providers in Medicare's ACO REACH program, driving opportunities to successful close with support from internal subject-matter experts, Growth team leaders, and executive support.



As an Enterprise Sales Associate, you will spearhead the early development of relationships with organizations managing large Primary Care Providers across the US, educating leadership on the benefits of value-based care broadly, the ACO REACH programs specifically, and how Pearl can help them succeed in stabilizing their revenue and participating in the value they create by effectively managing their patient panels.



This position requires the ability to make cold outreach to enterprise provider prospects, large integrated medical groups, community hospitals and large health systems and, concisely communicate with upper C-Level stakeholders, and walk them through sophisticated performance analyses and nuanced regulatory questions. You will exceed baseline performance metrics, understand the local dynamics of your assigned markets, and stay thoroughly informed on healthcare industry trends. A familiarity, passion, and willingness to dig into the possibilities offered by value-based care programs would make you an ideal candidate.



To be successful in this role you will…..


* Engage a market of prospective enterprise providers (primarily, large primary care and multispecialty physician medical group prospects; secondarily, Community Hospitals, ACO, CINs, IPAs/MSOs. and health system prospects) across communication channels (e.g. phone calls, email, fax, and other targeted campaigns).
* Build, manage, execute against targeting methodology, prospect funnel, relationships with key targets (especially large physician and hospital groups) to achieve key performance indicators
* Coordinate meetings with key stakeholders and prospective organizations.
* Demonstrate aptitude for relationship building and creating an exceptional experience for our providers.
* Design and improve the communication modules, outreach mechanisms, and rewards that further engagement with our provider partners
* Use database, CRM, or other software to meticulously track progress with opportunities as you manage your markets.
* Identify local and market-specific insights and willingness to travel to assigned geographies for live prospecting
* Attend networking events, community events, and conferences to generate awareness and produce sales leads with positive ROI
* Perform calculations and leverage analytics to provide prospects and existing partners with forecasted performance metrics


**Who you are. . .**


* Bachelor's degree or equivalent work experience
* 1-4 years of experience in sales and/or business development in the enterprise/large physician group space. Experience in healthcare, value based care, and/or ACO programs is a plus.
* You are relentless but patient. You are constantly hunting for prospects, but also understand that the contracting cycle requires lots of touches with potential partners.
* Experience owning an annual quota and utilizing sales CRM to manager and track
* Excellent communication, interpersonal and presentation skills
* A passion for improving and optimizing relationships
* Excited about helping physicians

We welcome candidates from all backgrounds and are committed to a fair hiring process free from discrimination and focused around problem solving, improvement, and mutual empowerment.

We are a remote-first company, with a concentration of team members at our NYC headquarters and in the Boston area.

Individual pay is determined by the candidate's hiring location and additional factors, including but not limited to skillset, experience, and relevant education, certifications, or training. Applicants may not be eligible for the full salary range based on their U.S. or Canada hiring location. The recruiter can share more details about compensation for the role in your location during the hiring process.
U.S. employees have **access** to quality medical, dental and vision insurance, a 401(k) plan with a Cisco matching contribution, short and long-term disability coverage, basic life insurance and numerous wellbeing offerings. Employees receive up to twelve paid holidays per calendar year, which includes one floating holiday, plus a day off for their birthday. Employees accrue up to 20 days of Paid Time Off (PTO) each year and have access to paid time away to deal with critical or emergency issues without tapping into their PTO. We offer additional paid time to volunteer and give back to the community. Employees are also able to purchase company stock through our Employee Stock Purchase Program.


Employees on sales plans earn performance-based incentive pay on top of their base salary, which is split between quota and non-quota components. For quota-based incentive pay, Cisco typically pays as follows:


.75% of incentive target for each 1% of revenue attainment up to 50% of quota;


1.5% of incentive target for each 1% of attainment between 50% and 75%;


1% of incentive target for each 1% of attainment between 75% and 100%; and once performance exceeds 100% attainment, incentive rates are at or above 1% for each 1% of attainment with no cap on incentive compensation.


For non-quota-based sales performance elements such as strategic sales objectives, Cisco may pay up to 125% of target. Cisco sales plans do not have a minimum threshold of performance for sales incentive compensation to be paid."
