A Career Guide**

What Does a Product Marketing Manager Do? A Career GuideWritten by Coursera Staff **Updated on Nov 29, 2023Share**

Learn what a product marketing manager does day-to-day, what you can expect to earn in this position, and the skills needed to enter this exciting role.

Product marketing managers, also called solutions marketing managers, work at the intersection of product development, marketing, and sales. Their broad responsibility is to develop and implement a marketing strategy roadmap for a specific product. In order to successfully reach their goal, product marketing managers typically work with colleagues across many departments throughout the product’s life cycle.

As their title suggests, product marketing managers focus heavily on marketing, so they often coordinate efforts with strategists across various marketing disciplines, including digital, social media, brand, and market research.

Cross-departmentally, product marketing managers may also work closely with product managers, user experience (UX) designers, engineers, and stakeholders in the product’s launch, including communications and sales teams. It can be helpful for product marketing managers to know a bit about how each of these departments works in order to efficiently work together.

Product manager vs. product marketing manager

A product manager oversees strategy as a product moves through the design and build process. A **product marketing manager** oversees the public-facing communication strategy about a product.

**Product marketing manager role and responsibilities**

A product marketing manager communicates the value of a specific product or products to people outside of the organisation, such as potential buyers, clients, or investors. Although the role can vary across different companies, here are some common responsibilities you may see in product marketing manager job descriptions:

* **Before a product launch**, product marketing managers may interpret market research and apply relevant findings to the development process. Their insights may impact aspects such as product features, user experience, naming, and packaging.
* **During a product launch**, product marketing managers will own the product’s go-to-market strategy. They’ll ensure that all messaging regarding the product is accurate and presented in a way that potential customers will care about. They may also oversee the creation of content about the product, including videos, blog posts, or slide presentations.

Data has become indispensable instrument for human-centered policies, good governance, decision-making and policy development. Data are produced and used with data systems being increasingly utilized by strategists and decision-makers. Informed organizations and institutions are better equipped to take decisions which serve the needs of various socio-economic groups and society in general. Evidence based decision-making is key to ensuring that development policies are comprehensive and lined up to serve all population groups. Hence, data gathering, analysis and dissemination is an important step in the cycle of policymaking.



Reliable data also increase public trust in institutional decisions and the transparency of interventions and policies. In this context, numerous countries in the region and wider are developing institutional infrastructure to gather, digitalize, store, manage and make data more available for decision-making and for research. Kosovo is still facing substantial problems in the implementation of Open Data among WB countries. The findings of a study on real-time monitoring of the dataset quality of open data in the Western Balkan, availability of low-quality dataset formats appears to be the biggest concern impacting data reuse. However digital transformation has a lot of potential due to institutional drive and commitment for a Digital Agenda and promotion of access to Open Government Data (OGD).



In the rapidly evolving data ecosystem with a focus on access to fast and accurate data has become a driving force for decision-makers, not least because of reduced resources offset by increased demand by the population. In this context, USAID and UNDP have partnered to bridge this data gap through the Public Pulse – a flagship research project, funded by USAID and implemented by UNDP, which has generated data spanning to 2002. Public Pulse has emerged as a stalwart of ‘data hub’ which responds to Kosovo’s needs for data availability and its use for informed policymaking.

* A relentless advocate –The children we serve and teachers we empower never leave your mind. You know them, get them, have shared a meal with them (or would be happy to in the future). You would never shrink back from shaking a parent’s hand or picking up a crying child, no matter what the person was wearing or looked like. Every decision you make considers their benefit, experience, and value.
* A malleable learner –You believe you can always do better. You welcome constructive criticism and provide it freely to others. You know you only get better tomorrow when others point out where you’ve missed things or failed today.
* A curious investigator – You ask why a lot. You don’t just take what you see and accept it. You wonder why it is that way, and are aware that the world we see is created by human choices and actions – and it could be different. You wonder, and see the world as wonderful even when you want to change a part of it that is unjust.
