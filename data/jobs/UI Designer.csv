-----------------------


Since we opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely, and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take payments and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together.  

  

So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, offer buy now, pay later functionality through Afterpay, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. Across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow in one place. Afterpay furthers our goal to provide omnichannel tools that unlock meaningful value and growth, enabling sellers to capture the next generation shopper, increase order sizes, and compete at a larger scale.  

  

Today, we are a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex operations, sellers just starting, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers grow, so do our solutions. There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a significant, meaningful, and lasting business, and we are helping sellers worldwide do the same.**Job Description**

Our customers rely on our products because they are well-designed, easy to use, and integrated with their business. We are a full-stack product oriented team, spanning across engineering, design, product, data science, and marketing. You’ll contribute to the roadmap and strategy decisions and will play a critical role in helping the team accomplish our industry-leading growth goals.


On the Invoices Front Door team, we focus on supporting advanced workflows for upmarket sellers who tend to have a longer sales lifecycle compared to in person sales. Invoices is unique to Square in that we can flex our products to be used complementary to sellers main point of sale, or serve as a complete business and payments stack solution. Our team is focused, fast-moving, and rapidly growing with an abundance of growth and impact opportunities. We focus on building the best tools to help our merchants close sales and get paid quickly.

* Are curious, eager, and able to understand the technical underpinnings of a problem in service of finding elegant solutions.

* Don't allow ""perfect"" to be the enemy of ""great,"" and are biased towards shipping in order to learn and deliver value.
* Know that requesting and giving feedback are the best way to up-level their work and others’.
* Are excited to work asynchronously with a global team.
**Skills and Experiences:*** Experience designing fairly technical and deep Web applications.

We're a global team (50% outside the US), fully distributed (from Thailand to California), who get things done asynchronously, with plenty of uninterrupted time, supporting each other to do the best work of our careers. We offer flexibility (define your own schedule and work from wherever you want), autonomy, and an environment that fosters growth, learning, and development. We're relentlessly user-focused and believe in building long-term value, not short-term hacks. And we raised a $30M Series B to take our approach to the next level for years to come.

Spry Fox
ABOUT OUR TEAM
Our motto is, “make the world a better place”; and we try to do this through the games we make. Invention is part of our DNA at Spry Fox. Whether it’s by designing MMOs that encourage the development of friendships and discourage toxicity, or by designing unique puzzle games that promote English language learning; we’re always asking ourselves “how does this game improve your life?”  

Spry Fox strives to be a studio that is a pleasure to work for, an important but not dominating part of your life, and recognizes crunch is a negative, counter-productive industry practice — something to be learned from and avoided in the future. We want you to have friends, family, hobbies, and a life outside of work. We want you to love your colleagues and know that they support you 100%. We want you to be proud of what you do and how you do it.  

For 10+ years, we’ve been fully remote with Foxes scattered all over the world. To make that work well, we all try to be online and communicative from 10am to 2pm PST to ensure that we have enough overlapping work hours with our team; otherwise, our schedules are flexible and fully under our individual control!  

Now that we’re a part of Netflix, we can do what we love with more support and without having to worry about how to monetize! We’ve always been focused on making thoughtful, original games… now more than ever.

You'll collaborate with the design team to turn wireframes into shipping quality UI, and with the engineering team to grow and maintain a set of reusable components. As the UI Artist/Designer, you will be responsible for structuring our UI to work across a variety of experiences (e.g. mobile and more) and navigate tradeoffs between visual quality, performance, and maintenance.**Responsibilities**

* Author high quality, stylized UI assets that compliment the look of in-game 3D assets
* Collaborate with art direction and designers to improve the quality and usability of the overall UI, within the constraints created by design
* Maintain and improve a pipeline for authoring high-quality, stylized UI assets that complement the look of in-game 3D assets
* Integrate UI assets into UMG widgets and use Blueprint to create and maintain standardized components
* Regular, ongoing, open communication with team members about your work and status (Slack, Google Meet, email is critical)
**Requirements**
----------------

* Experience working with the latest versions of Unreal – structuring UI in UMG and creating widget Blueprints
* A portfolio that demonstrates solid UI design skills, as well as 2D asset creation
* Experience designing user experiences and UI for games, including a deep understanding of game mechanics, player motivations, game flow
* A deep understanding of how design translates to code and how your decisions will affect development complexity and timelines.
* Strong communication skills including clear and proactive communication and capable of conveying a range of complex technical issues to both programmers and non-technical team members
**Nice To Have**
----------------

* Experience shipping UI in Unreal, especially on mobile
* Motion graphics experience for mobile games
