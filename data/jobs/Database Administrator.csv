**Location:** Remote  
**Rate:** $40/ hour  
**Estimated weekly hours:** 5-10

“Wow! [Your Name Here] is the best Data Administrator we’ve ever seen!”

How do you know if this is your dream work and if Fertility Bridge is your dream client? If you think you can achieve these outcomes, this just might be the place for you:

* **All data entered into 4-6 data inputs are all the same fields and data points**. Currently includes Squarespace, Hubspot, MailChimp, FormSite and perhaps others. All data entered into these various inputs should adhere to the same set of fields and data points. This ensures that the data is consistent, accurate, and aligned with the organization's requirements.
* **Data input properly connected to data storage**. Ensuring seamless integration between data inputs and the chosen data storage solution from outcome 2 is critical for efficient data flow and accessibility. This involves configuring data input sources (Squarespace, Hubspot, Mail Chimp, FormSite) to feed data seamlessly into the storage provider. The goal is to create a robust pipeline for real-time updates and retrieval.
* **Data processing and extraction pipeline followed and refined**. The established pipeline should incorporate mechanisms for real-time or scheduled data extraction, handling varying data volumes, and adapting to evolving data structures. It is essential to consider factors such as data validation, cleansing, and transformation during the extraction process to maintain data integrity. Moreover, the pipeline should be designed with scalability in mind, allowing it to accommodate future growth and changes in data complexity. Documentation of the pipeline architecture, processes, and dependencies is crucial for maintaining transparency and facilitating ongoing improvements.

\\*  
What we think we have for you to achieve your outcome(s):\\*

* Access to each data input: Squarespace, Hubspot, Mail Chimp, FormSite, but there is currently no established data storage solution.
* Map of how we think our data inputs function now.
* Access to the operations team and founder for insights into internal team requirements and client needs.
* Access to Hubspot and MailChimp data entry personnel to understand manual data input process.
* Access to IRH (Inside Reproductive Health) team member responsible for manual contact data input in HubSpot to inquire about the current process of entering data.
* Access to IRH team member handling manual subscriber data input in Mailchimp for insights into the current procedures for data entry.

\\*  
What we don’t have (**\\**YET!*****) for you to achieve your outcome(s):**

* No existing process for seamless integration of data across platforms.
* No central template for what data inputs we want.
* Limited expertise within the IRH team regarding the technical aspects and data connection.
* Don’t know how or how well data inputs integrate. Limited understanding of how well data inputs (Squarespace, Hubspot, Mail Chimp, FormSite) currently integrate with each other and with the chosen data storage provider; further exploration and analysis are required to optimize these connections.
* No process for how to input data from data inputs to data storage provider. We need you to build that process.
* No defined process for transferring data from the various inputs to the designated data storage provider. Your expertise is needed to design and implement a structured process for efficient data input and storage.
* No formal documentation outlining potential challenges or bottlenecks in the current data input and storage setup. Conducting a thorough assessment to identify and address potential issues is crucial for a smooth integration process.
* No existing framework for data processing and extraction.
* No dedicated IT security teams available to implement essential data encryption and protection measures within the processing pipeline.
* No documentation on the specific data processing requirements and standards.

Today a handful of corporations control 90% of the world's data and IT infrastructure and we are expected to trust them. This is not just bad for business; it's bad for everyone. Information asymmetry has led to social inequality, scandals, polarization, and corruption. Sometimes, it has even led to war. Centralized data control acts as a potential chokepoint for innovation, raises privacy concerns, and creates a bottleneck for the free flow of data.



Openmesh is a cutting-edge new open-source cloud infrastructure and a global open data network aimed at storing important global data without a middleman. It is the largest open web3 data lake, covering approximately 80% of the entire crypto and web3 ecosystem today. In 2023 and 2024, we aim to expand our data coverage to include public health and scientific research data.



Openmesh enables anyone to create their own decentralized data cloud, connect globally, share data securely, slash deployment costs, and automate data cloud setup. The Openmesh Network is designed to collect, store, process, stream, and provide data connectivity for anyone, anywhere, anytime, without the need for registration, licensing, or payments. Think of Openmesh as the internet's open data fabric. It grants universal access and prevents interferences created by regulators, governments, corporations, and even its own creators. The possibilities are endless.


**Core Products**



Our flagship product, Xnode, is an integral part of this vision, offering a revolutionary platform for developers to build decentralized data clouds. Xnode, enables developers to build their own decentralized data clouds with data connectivity, data APIs, and query & analytics engines in mere minutes, instead of weeks or months. They pay only for computing and storage, sidestepping licensing and setup fees. Xnode facilitates a 10-15 fold cost reduction in running and operating data clouds and can save over 95% of deployment time.



Pythia is a powerhouse analytics & query engine that transforms raw data into actionable insights. Pythia allows anyone to design, build, visualize, and deploy powerful data products.



Unified APIs provide a single endpoint for all crypto & web3 data, making it accessible to anyone, anywhere, without any costs. There are no licenses, registrations, or setup fees involved.


**Our vision**



Our vision is to democratize data and address information asymmetry at a scale. Data & information is the most valuable commodity in the world. Without quality, reliable data, all webpages, apps, and the entire internet will stop working. We believe access to reliable, unedited information is a fundamental right- an aspect of a free and democratic society. The Core Principles of Openmesh, by design, has no single authority that can alter its data, how the information is distributed or controlled, or who can see what and when. The infrastructure and entire technology stack is open-source and governed by an open-source community.


**About the Role**
