Biological products are transforming what we eat, what we wear, how and *how long* we live. Automation can supercharge the rate of discovering these game changing products. However, existing lab robots lack the software tools that scientists need to quickly and easily scale biological product development. That’s where we come in.

Spaero builds a software system that empowers scientists to dramatically scale the rate of biological product discovery by enabling fast and flexible lab automation.

We are backed by top tier investors and our experienced team is led by repeat founder Mitch Adler, who co-founded autonomous aerospace company Skyryse and was the first employee at industrial robotics software company Symbio Robotics.

**APRIMO CULTURE & WHY YOU’LL LOVE WORKING HERE:**


* Aprimo offers a forward-thinking, progressive and employee-first culture that is based in both collaboration and flexibility with team members who are friendly, intelligent and enthusiastic people that are committed to the product and mission here at Aprimo.
	+ With 5 offices worldwide and teams spread throughout the US, EMEA and Philippines, our multicultural teams work cross-departmentally and across continents and cultures towards a shared goal.
	+ We offer a diverse environment that promotes DEI efforts, values multiple perspectives and fresh thinking and which includes Aprimo HELPS, an employee resource group (ERG) that is dedicated to giving back to our local communities.
* Through its relaxed environment, Aprimo embodies a more casual “Silicon Valley” atmosphere.
	+ We have a casual dress code that allows employees to express themselves as individuals and which fosters a creative and free-thinking approach to problem solving and business solutions. And it also allows us to wear hoodies and shorts during internal meetings.
* Unlimited PTO, flexible work schedules and all positions allowing for either entirely remote or hybrid working arrangements create a deeply rewarding work-life balance.
	+ Our unlimited PTO encourages employees to take time off to un-plug, rest, and recharge.
	+ With flexible work schedules, employees can attend to personal matters, such as stepping away to pick up their children from school or to get a much-needed haircut.
	+ *In a recent internal survey, 89% of staff cited work-life balance as being one of the most rewarding aspects of working at Aprimo!*
* Part of the key to our success is that team members are not only successful at collaboration and open communication, but that they are also given a great deal of autonomy and freedom in their own individual roles.
	+ Our culture is not a micro-managing environment – rather, employees are encouraged to be self-starters, to voice new ideas, and to exercise ownership in their individual roles.
	+ As such, individual team members can leave a lasting impact and footprint within the organization – in fact, our average employee tenure is 7.7 years.
* Aprimo employs a “choose your own adventure” approach to career advancement.
	+ Staff members are not siloed into roles and for many of our teams there is no set ladder that one needs to climb to achieve growth and promotion.
	+ Rather, we emphasize an organic approach to career development in which employees can and do frequently transition into newly created roles within their own teams or transition into other departments based on their interests in exploring new skills and responsibilities.
	+ For additional learning and development, we recently rolled out Udemy, which is an online learning platform that employees have access to and which features over 200,000 courses on a wide variety of business topics.
