**Hours of work:** Typical hours of work are from 8:30 AM until 5:00 PM Monday through Friday. Additional hours may be necessary as needed. This position is exempt from overtime.  

  

**Compensation:** Depends on Experience  

  

**Who we are****:** InVita develops specialized software for regulated industries that support the advancement of public health and safety. We are the acknowledged leader in the markets we serve. Our subject matter expertise is unmatched in the industry and our products are used by public health and medical professionals across the globe. We have employees spanning across the US and two main offices (Baltimore & Los Angeles).
  

  

**Overview****:** ***Provide cutting-edge software solutions to save more lives through the miracle of transplantation***: that’s our goal here.
  

And as the world’s leading provider of human biologics (organ, tissue, eye, birth tissue, etc.) donation and transplantation software, we’re incredibly proud that our modern, web-based solutions have already enabled millions of lives to be saved and healed around the globe.
  

  

It’s an exciting time for us. We not only have a steady and continually growing stream of new partners adopting use of our award-winning, secure cloud-based**iTransplant**SM Platform, but we remain tireless in our journey to continually evolve and expand our portfolio of products - including the build-out of entirely new revolutionary clinical solutions to transform and improve this key space.

You cringe when you see references to “HIPPA”. And you can successfully administer the 5 Whys technique without being too annoying.
* **You enjoy occasional Travel:** You enjoy face-to-face time, know the value of Clear and TSA Pre, and (whenever possible) usually carry-on to hit the ground running.
