* Develops clear visuals, dashboards and reports that provide insight into fleet performance, support decision making and help our FMIS customers tell their story with data.
* Gives clear context about data to Fleet Managers, rather than just reporting a number.
* Develops client-ready sophisticated deliverables that are professionally crafted, contributing to RTA’s positive brand image.

* Bonus points for any certifications or industry accolades they’ve earned.

And extra bonus points if you went back and checked to see how many times we asked! You know you want to apply, but maybe we’re not the kind of Hogwarts you are looking for?

Businesses of all sizes leverage the B-Stock platform to sell and buy customer returns, overstock and other excess merchandise - ranging from top brands and retailers who want best-in-class inventory management to entrepreneurs looking to source valuable merchandise for their resale businesses.



Tens of thousands of small business owners all over the globe use B-Stock to launch and power their resale business. We take pride in empowering these innovators and entrepreneurs of commerce.



In 2020 we sold 120 million items across our platform, giving a second life to this otherwise would be ""waste"" merchandise. In fact, we kept 400 million pounds of goods in use and saved millions from the landfill. It feels good to be B-Stock!



The amount of returned or unsold inventory continues to grow each year, and in 2020, it was estimated at over $1 trillion worth worldwide. We know there is tremendous value in and demand for this inventory - no matter the category, condition, or location. The B-Stock platform gives buyers a simple way to buy brand-name merchandise directly from top retailers and manufacturers. At the same time, we offer companies an automated, trusted replacement for traditional liquidation while boosting operational efficiency, recovery rates, and cycle time.



Led by eBay veterans and backed by top investors including Spectrum Equity, True Ventures, and Susquehanna Growth Equity, B-Stock shows no signs of slowing down. Our core values have shaped the company we are today and will continue to drive our success for many years to come.

***Take Our Work Seriously, Not Ourselves***  

Everything at B-Stock continues to grow - everything but our egos, that is. We're not afraid to let loose and laugh (often at ourselves).


***Do The Hard Things Today That Will Pay Off Tomorrow***  

We're willing to sacrifice and endure, fail and adapt to reach our long-term goals.


***Use Trust As The Best Measure Of Success***  

The trust we earn along the way is more valuable than money. Without trust from both our buyers and sellers, our business won't succeed.


***Find Strength In Numbers***  

Use our passion for data to provide value to our customers, improve ourselves, and develop new ways to delight our buyers and sellers.

**What We Do, How We Do It**


Too often, companies use a piecemeal approach when it comes to screening drivers. They might use one vendor to help recruit. Another to screen.

Not to mention, it makes it too easy for things to fall through the cracks.


At Foley, we've built a company that effortlessly manages these three areas under one roof: recruit, screen, comply. Thanks to powerful technology combined with our compliance expertise, we're able to deliver a comprehensive solution to our customers and, as a result, a better overall customer experience.


**Where We're Headed**


We're always developing new solutions to slay tomorrow's recruitment, screening, and compliance monsters. At the core of these solutions is our vast collection of data—and the many ways to leverage it, whether that's developing software to calculate a company's compliance risk or implementing predictive analytics to identify the best drivers.


**What It's Like to Work with Us**


Diving deep into a niche industry and becoming an expert . . .


Continually growing and advancing . . .


Making lifelong friends during the process . . .

Multicoin Capital is a thesis-driven investment firm that invests in cryptocurrencies, tokens, and blockchain companies reshaping trillion-dollar markets. We manage a hedge fund and several venture funds, investing across both public and private markets.

Since founding the firm in May 2017, we have quickly grown to become one of the largest crypto-focused investment firms in the world. We are widely recognized for our contrarian investments.

While our mandate is to produce exemplary returns for our investors, we also feel the call to shepherd one of the most promising, complex, fast-moving asset classes in modern history to mainstream adoption.

Multicoin is a nimble firm by design. We are the leanest of our peers with just 17 full time employees (excluding assistants). We believe this creates an environment that expedites decision making, and gives all team members an opportunity to work directly with Kyle and Tushar.

The company is full remote. That said, we do have clusters of employees in Austin, TX and NYC.

We do not require any formal education or work experience. We will evaluate candidates per the application instructions below.

We’re looking for an analyst that shares our passion and curiosity to join our investment team.

**Job Description**

As a full-time analyst, you’ll be expected to be an active member of the investment team. Your work will be wide-ranging and hands on, and will require you to play in many different crypto arenas. You will be expected to meet with teams, conduct analysis and due diligence, write internal memos, and present to the broader team.

Writing, curiosity, and critical thinking are by far the most important attributes for team members in this position. We don't over index on resumes or accolades. We’re looking for individuals that have a strong, foundational understanding of the crypto industry and that know how to think from first principles.

While it’s not necessary, we’re also especially fond of candidates who are technical, and/or who can read or speak other languages (Chinese, Korean, Russian, or Japanese).

You will have a lot of freedom to do as you see fit. We expect everyone on the investment team to find new opportunities, and that inherently requires autonomy.

**Application Process** 

This is a hands-on, interactive position, therefore, this is an interactive application process.

The first step in the process is to produce a written analysis that's on par with the essays we publish on our blog. We don't expect you to write a 12-page formal asset analysis. But the quality of your application essay should be on par with what we regularly produce. Please read our blog to establish a baseline prior to applying.

We’re looking for applicants to present a sound hypothesis and then to substantiate it. Any subject within crypto is fair game so long as you’re specific.

The more contrarian, the better, too.

We are not looking for macro theses, such as ""Bitcoin is going to change the world for X, Y, and Z reasons,"" or ""Why Smart Contracts Matter,"" or ""Why Jamie Dimon is wrong about Bitcoin,"" or ""How blockchains are going to reshape X."" We are also not looking for an overview of crypto generally or any one particular asset. We’re looking for you to be very specific, and to take a non-consensus view and defend it.

There are a few ways to accomplish this. You could write something like ""*Proof of Physical Work""*, ""*Infinite Scale""*, or ""*Protocols don't capture value, DAOs manage risk""* (all of these essays can be found on our blog). You could call out some deep flaw or failed token mechanic in a high profile project *and* explain the impact on valuation. You could highlight a trend that is failing or working across a number of projects that demonstrate your ability to differentiate signals from noise. Anything that demonstrates deep analysis and unique insights.

Any length is fine. If you can blow us away in 50 words, great. Proving you write concisely is fantastic. Feel free to leverage any graphics or videos from around the web to make your case. Or make your own. Whatever's necessary to communicate clearly.

Do not optimize for speed. Optimize for quality.

If you're concerned that we're close to issuing an offer to someone else and don't want to risk the time commitment, just ask.

**To Apply** 

To apply, please email your resume and application essay to spencer@multicoin.capital using the subject ""Analyst applicant - [Your name]""

Feel free to ask Spencer questions on Twitter (@SpencerApplebau) as you're thinking about or crafting your application.

We do not look at applicants who click ""I'm Interested"" or ""Apply"" buttons on Indeed or other sites.

We look forward to hearing from you.
