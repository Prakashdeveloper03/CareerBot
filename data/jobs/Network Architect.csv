**Solutions Architect**

***(This position is hybrid and required to work 2 days a week in the Denton Texas Support Center)***


Our commitments are to build a truly diverse and inclusive company, care for our customers, people, and planet, and outperform together.

**Essential Function**


The solutions architect is accountable for proactively and holistically leading or supporting EA activities for creating deliverables that guide the developing direction for managing a portfolio of solutions in response to disruptive forces, and driving achieving targeted business outcomes. Solutions include systems (including applications, technologies, processes and information), shared infrastructure services and shared application services.


Solutions architects provide the necessary leadership, analysis and design tasks related to the development of an enterprise's solutions architecture. This individual creates deliverables that help develop a direction for managing the organization's portfolio of ""to be"" and ""as is"" solutions — including systems (meaning not just applications, but also processes and information), shared infrastructure services, and shared application services and components to better match targeted business outcome objectives. Solutions architecture is sometimes used interchangeably with applications and infrastructure architecture. However, both aforementioned typically fall under the purview of the solutions architect.


Application architecture is a subset of solutions architecture. It's the discipline that guides application design and defines application architecture paradigms, such as service-oriented architecture (SOA), principles that influence design decisions and patterns that provide proven design solutions.


Solutions architects leverage and use technology solutions to enable the organization's future-state business capabilities that, in turn, drive the organization's targeted outcomes. They facilitate and orchestrate the delivery of targeted business outcomes.

India Systems Development Lab (ISDL) is part of IBM Systems world-wide technology development lab. Established in 1996, the Lab is headquartered in India's Silicon Valley and startup hub - Bengaluru, with a strong presence in Pune and Hyderabad. Developers at ISDL deliver technology innovations across the entire Systems portfolio - z Systems, Power / OpenPOWER Systems and Storage. The team here works across the entire stack from processor design, firmware, operating system to software defined storage. The lab also focuses on innovations, thanks to the creative energies of the teams. The lab has contributed over 400+ patents in cutting edge technologies and inventions so far.  

While computing veers towards cognitive, cloud, mobile, social, and security, the lab has significantly contributed to not just new products focused in these areas, but has also ushered in new development models such as Agile, Design Thinking and DevOps.  

  

Your Role and Responsibilities  

**Who you are:**  

We are IBM ZOS (Z Operating System) - IBM Z Network Configuration Assistant Product team working on Z Enterprise Systems and we build the most secure systems for our Banking and Enterprise customers to deploy their mission critical applications. Also, We provide atmost security and Data management on Z systems. The mission critical applications run on zOS and The IBM® Configuration Assistant for z/OS® Communications Server, an optional GUI-based tool, provides a guided interface for configuring TCP/IP policy-based networking functions. You can use the IBM Configuration Assistant for z/OS Communications Server to generate the Policy Agent files.  

  

The IBM Configuration Assistant for z/OS Communications Server is a z/OS Management Facility (z/OSMF) task. z/OSMF provides a web browser interface for a variety of z/OS system management functions. When you invoke the IBM Configuration Assistant for z/OS Communications Server in z/OSMF, the IBM Configuration Assistant for z/OS Communications Server runs natively in the z/OS system and you can access it through a web browser.  

  

Through a series of wizards and online help panels, you can use the IBM Configuration Assistant for z/OS Communications Server to create AT-TLS configuration files for any number of z/OS images with any number of TCP/IP stacks per image. Using the IBM Configuration Assistant for z/OS Communications Server, there are three types of reusable objects:  

  

Traffic descriptors that define the local application, by describing the TCP traffic with ports or identifying the application using its jobname.  

Security levels that define the different ways to protect data, such as the encryption level.  

Requirement maps that map traffic descriptors to security levels. A single requirement map should contain a complete set of security requirements that will govern the level of security for multiple IP traffic types.  

  

For each TCP/IP stack, you create a set of connectivity rules that indicate the data endpoints and indicate which requirement map will govern security between the data endpoints.  

  

The IBM Configuration Assistant for z/OS Communications Server comes with a number of IBM-supplied traffic descriptors, security levels, and requirement maps that are easily applied, or you can use the IBM-supplied definitions as the basis for your own set of reusable objects.  

  

The IBM Configuration Assistant for z/OS Communications Server can dramatically reduce the amount of time that is required to create AT-TLS policy files, contributing to ease of configuration and maintenance. Because of the inherently complex nature of z/OS security, using the GUI can help you ensure that you have a consistent and easily manageable interface for implementing AT-TLS security.  

  

**What you’ll do:**  

To Build the world most secure system via Z systems which helps customers to deploy their application, also provide a platform to deploy Private Cloud, Stand alone systems hosting mission critical application, also to defend againist threats like Cyber Threats, etc and making the enablement experience quicker and easier.
