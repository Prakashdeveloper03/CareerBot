**ResultStack – Who We Are**

We are a systems engineering team with members from a variety of professional backgrounds who are united in a quest to deliver enterprise-class solutions to our clients. This includes building scalable, secure, consumer-facing web and mobile apps for a variety of audiences and business needs.

Our process is simple – we work in close collaboration with our clients to create solutions that address their unique challenges. We work with our clients, not as an implementation vendor, but as a strategic partner. We seek to understand their needs, call upon our unique experiences and prescribe solutions that address their strategic goals.

**What We’re Looking For**  
You engineer systems. You understand that complexity is easy and simplicity is hard - and chose to do the hard things. Clean and efficient code is important to you. You want to build things that have meaning and take on big challenges.

You see the whole picture. You know how to architect systems - and that systems are more than just technical requirements. You understand how to build people, solutions, and engage with clients. You have led a team to accomplish more than it's individual contributors.

You want to build. You lead the team, but not from a distance. You enjoy rolling up your sleeves and working alongside the team. You're willing to do the hard work no one else wants to.

You have an entrepreneurial spirit. You understand that no plan survives first contact with the enemy and see each new challenge through to the end. You choose action over inaction. You take calculated risks and can communicate the potential risks and outcomes.

You are passionate about building great software. Quality is very important to you. You understand the value of testing: unit tests, automated testing, performance testing.

You understand the responsibility that comes with building consumer facing applications – either as part of a team team or by yourself - and are excited by the opportunity to create systems that consumers use and depend on.

You understand software development, not just tool xyz or framework foo. Your experience extends into many tools and frameworks and are always experimenting with the latest tech to see how it can help you solve new problems. While you have a wide range of exposure to frameworks and tools, once you find The (latest) One, you dive in and become an expert.

You think in terms of scale. Once you make it work, you think about how it'll work at scale: what happens when there are 100 users? 10,000 users? 1,000,000 users? Make it work, make it right.

You pay attention. Pick one of the previous eight what we're looking for points that you most relate to and list it in your resume or cover letter to know that you actually read this.

**Preferred Experience**  
Experience consulting with clients - either on the side or as a part of your job responsibilities.  
Experience developing consumer-facing software.  
Experience working on large scale applications.  
Cloud development and architecture with AWS or Azure.  
Application performance optimization and tuning best practices.  
Application security best practices.  
Frontend development such as JavaScript, Angular, React, Vue, Ember, etc.  
Back-end development such as Node.js, .NET (C#), etc.  
Fullstack experience working with both front-end and the backend technologies.  
Experience with TypeScript.  
Responsive design with CSS or CSS frameworks.  
Design frameworks such as Bootstrap, Foundation, Tailwind, etc.  
Automating testing, integration, deployments, monitoring.  
Must have a strong customer service orientation, good organizational skills and the ability to work independently.

We are a systems engineering team with members from a variety of professional backgrounds who are united in a quest to deliver enterprise-class solutions to our clients. This includes building scalable, secure, consumer-facing web and mobile apps for a variety of audiences and business needs.

Our process is simple – we work in close collaboration with our clients to create solutions that address their unique challenges. We work with our clients, not as an implementation vendor, but as a strategic partner. We seek to understand their needs, call upon our unique experiences and prescribe solutions that address their strategic goals.

**What We’re Looking For**  
You engineer systems. You understand that complexity is easy and simplicity is hard - and chose to do the hard things. Clean and efficient code is important to you. You want to build things that have meaning and take on big challenges.

You see the whole picture. You know how to architect systems - and that systems are more than just technical requirements. You understand how to build people, solutions, and engage with clients. You have led a team to accomplish more than it's individual contributors.

You understand the responsibility that comes with building consumer facing applications – either as part of a team team or by yourself - and are excited by the opportunity to create systems that consumers use and depend on.

You understand software development, not just tool xyz or framework foo. Your experience extends into many tools and frameworks and are always experimenting with the latest tech to see how it can help you solve new problems. While you have a wide range of exposure to frameworks and tools, once you find The (latest) One, you dive in and become an expert.

You think in terms of scale. Once you make it work, you think about how it'll work at scale: what happens when there are 100 users? 10,000 users? 1,000,000 users? Make it work, make it right.

**Preferred Experience**  
Experience consulting with clients - either on the side or as a part of your job responsibilities.

We’re a group of hard-working overachievers who are deeply focused on building the future of finance and Web3 for our users across the globe, whether they’re trading, storing, staking or using crypto. Know those people who always lead the group project? That’s us.



There are a few things we look for across all hires we make at Coinbase, regardless of role or team. First, we look for candidates who will thrive in a culture like ours, where we default to trust, embrace feedback, and disrupt ourselves. Second, we expect all employees to commit to our mission-focused approach to our work. Finally, we seek people who are excited to learn about and live crypto, because those are the folks who enjoy the intense moments in our sprint and recharge work culture. We’re a remote-first company looking to hire the absolute best talent all over the world.



Ready to #LiveCrypto? Who you are:


* You’ve got positive energy. You’re optimistic about the future and determined to get there.
* You’re never tired of learning. You want to be a pro in bleeding edge tech like DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, and Web 3.0.
* You appreciate direct communication. You’re both an active communicator and an eager listener - because let’s face it, you can’t have one without the other. You’re cool with candid feedback and see every setback as an opportunity to grow.
* You can pivot on the fly. Crypto is constantly evolving, so our priorities do, too. What you worked on last month may not be what you work on today, and that excites you. You’re not looking for a boring job.
* You have a “can do” attitude. Our teams create high-quality work on quick timelines. Owning a problem doesn’t scare you, but rather empowers you to take 100% responsibility for achieving our mission.
* You want to be part of a winning team. We’re stronger together, and you’re a person who embraces being pushed out of your comfort zone.
We believe that the onchain platform is the most important builder platform since the internet (“online”). We believe that the onchain platform should be open source, free to use, and globally available. And we believe that in order to make it really work, we need all hands on deck, working together to scale in a secure, decentralized, easy-to-use way.



Base is incubated within Coinbase and plans to progressively decentralize in the years ahead. We believe that decentralization is critical to creating an open, global crypto economy that is accessible to everyone.



Base is built on Optimism’s open-source OP Stack. We’re joining as the second Core Dev team working on the OP Stack to ensure it’s a public good available to everyone; and contributing a portion of sequencer revenue to funding public goods.



We are looking for a Staff Smart Contract Engineer to join the Base team to help enable and accelerate the success of Base. You’ll be working with us as a Core Dev on the open-source OP Stack, which will power the next generation of onchain activity through the Superchain. In addition to direct protocol and smart contract work, you’ll be helping define Coinbase’s path to having a world-class smart contract engineering competency.



What you'll do:


* Architect and build secure smart contract protocols to connect Coinbase users with the crypto ecosystem
* Drive standardization in crypto protocols by designing and defining interfaces and standards
* Work closely with the Base leadership and product team to set our onchain strategy and roadmaps
* Mentor and train other team members and teams on smart contract engineering best practices


What we look for in you:


* 3+ year Experience with Solidity and smart contract development
* 5+ year Experience with backend/client side development
* Deep understanding of smart contract best practices and current industry patterns
* You’ve brought multiple protocols from 0 through audit to production, and seen iterations and success of your projects
* You have strong opinions (loosely held) on current developments in the Ethereum technical roadmap - including account abstraction and rollup architectures
* Interest and passion for contributing to the crypto ecosystem


Nice to haves:


* Experience with Go
* Experience with zero-knowledge technology
* Contributions to open source crypto projects

Your Role and Responsibilities  

**Who you are:**  

We are IBM ZOS (Z Operating System) - IBM Z Network Configuration Assistant Product team working on Z Enterprise Systems and we build the most secure systems for our Banking and Enterprise customers to deploy their mission critical applications. Also, We provide atmost security and Data management on Z systems. The mission critical applications run on zOS and The IBM® Configuration Assistant for z/OS® Communications Server, an optional GUI-based tool, provides a guided interface for configuring TCP/IP policy-based networking functions. You can use the IBM Configuration Assistant for z/OS Communications Server to generate the Policy Agent files.  

  

The IBM Configuration Assistant for z/OS Communications Server is a z/OS Management Facility (z/OSMF) task. z/OSMF provides a web browser interface for a variety of z/OS system management functions. When you invoke the IBM Configuration Assistant for z/OS Communications Server in z/OSMF, the IBM Configuration Assistant for z/OS Communications Server runs natively in the z/OS system and you can access it through a web browser.  

  

Through a series of wizards and online help panels, you can use the IBM Configuration Assistant for z/OS Communications Server to create AT-TLS configuration files for any number of z/OS images with any number of TCP/IP stacks per image. Using the IBM Configuration Assistant for z/OS Communications Server, there are three types of reusable objects:  

  

Traffic descriptors that define the local application, by describing the TCP traffic with ports or identifying the application using its jobname.  

Security levels that define the different ways to protect data, such as the encryption level.  

Requirement maps that map traffic descriptors to security levels. A single requirement map should contain a complete set of security requirements that will govern the level of security for multiple IP traffic types.  

  

For each TCP/IP stack, you create a set of connectivity rules that indicate the data endpoints and indicate which requirement map will govern security between the data endpoints.  

  

The IBM Configuration Assistant for z/OS Communications Server comes with a number of IBM-supplied traffic descriptors, security levels, and requirement maps that are easily applied, or you can use the IBM-supplied definitions as the basis for your own set of reusable objects.  

  

The IBM Configuration Assistant for z/OS Communications Server can dramatically reduce the amount of time that is required to create AT-TLS policy files, contributing to ease of configuration and maintenance. Because of the inherently complex nature of z/OS security, using the GUI can help you ensure that you have a consistent and easily manageable interface for implementing AT-TLS security.

 Over the last three decades, organizations globally have spent billions of dollars in cybersecurity, focusing specifically on “perimeter” security. Perimeter solutions such as firewalls and user access (ZTNA) focus on keeping the bad actors out. However, with perimeters dissolving with remote work and cloud migration, they continue to lose effectiveness making them easy to breach. Perimeter security provides no protection within the organization’s internal networks which carry up to 85% of all traffic. The lack of internal controls provides ample real estate for attackers to lurk and carry out damaging attacks.



 This is where ColorTokens comes in. With its industry-recognized Zero Trust Micro-segmentation platform, ColorTokens delivers deep visibility and granular security control across the entire enterprise. Security teams can create a Zero Trust Architecture based on the principle of least privilege from data center, to cloud, to OT and IoT infrastructure by “seeing” and controlling every traffic flow. Our unique platform enables fast and seamless implementation delivering measurable risk reduction even in the most complex organizations.


**Our culture:**



 We foster an environment that values customer focus, innovation, collaboration, mutual respect, and informed decision-making. We believe in alignment and empowerment so you can own and drive projects autonomously.



 Self-starters and highly-motivated individuals will enjoy the rewarding experience of solving complex challenges that protect some of the world’s most impactful organizations – be it a children’s hospital, or a city, or the defense department of an entire country.
