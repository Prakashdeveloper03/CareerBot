Avalara works with businesses of all sizes, all over the world — from corner stores to gigantic global retailers — to calculate tax accurately and automatically, at speeds measured in milliseconds.

Do you have a passion for data analytics? What about a passion for fleet management? Do you thrive by finding innovative solutions for complex problems? Do you enjoy helping customers improve their operations? Do you get a thrill seeing them make better decisions based on data you provided? Lastly, does the idea of building your dream analytics and reporting solution for an FMIS excite you? If so, read on…

The Product Team at RTA is looking for a Fleet Data Analytics Specialist. This role will have two major parts to play at RTA.

Sound like you? You could be a (Fleet Data) wizard, Harry! Read on!

In general, someone who:

* Is comfortable being a part of a product team that thrives on healthy conflict. This means they aren’t afraid to mix it up or be open to new ideas.
* Is willing to be accountable to the team and willing to hold team members accountable as well. People with trust issues need not apply. No, seriously.
* Passionately cares about our clients and helping them be more successful. Our clients are fleet managers, parts clerks, and automotive technicians, who maintain everything from squad cars to school buses so that everyone comes home safely at the end of the day.
* Thinks of themselves less, while not thinking less of themselves. They are other-centric, compassionate, and self-assured.
* Is willing to lift boxes, clean floors, and hold doors if that’s what it takes to get something done, because no job is beneath them.
* Takes ownership and initiative in their job. They don’t wait to be told what to do, they own their role, and how to make it better.
* Loves to read, learn, grow, and stretch themselves. Bonus points for each book they’ve read by Patrick Lencioni.

Specifically for this job, someone who:

* Understands which metrics matter, why they matter, how to improve them, or where to look if they are below standard.
* Has experience building tools to help data analysts with their day-to-day work
* Sniffs-out bad fleet data elements and helps to clean the data.
* Queries the data directly and/or use automated tools to extract the data using technology (like SQL Server, Make, or others)
* Understands what trends to look for, and which ones to ignore.
* Utilizes data visualization tools and technology (like SQL Server, Excel, Power BI, Tableau, Qlik, Exago, or others) to get the answers they need for fleets.
* Develops clear visuals, dashboards and reports that provide insight into fleet performance, support decision making and help our FMIS customers tell their story with data.
* Gives clear context about data to Fleet Managers, rather than just reporting a number.
* Develops client-ready sophisticated deliverables that are professionally crafted, contributing to RTA’s positive brand image.
* Documents their thought processes and expertise into use cases and stories giving the development team the necessary context while they engineer the product.
* Bonus points for any certifications or industry accolades they’ve earned.
* Has excellent communication skills, both written and verbal, and enjoys interacting with fleet staff and software developers alike.

Does this sound like your kind of witchcraft and wizardry? Let’s talk!

Key Results Areas (aka the Job Outcomes)

* RTA’s web FMIS has a fully implemented data visualization tool and a comprehensive set of default dashboards, reports, and visualizations, and gains a reputation as one of the best FMIS available to Fleet Managers.
* Consultants are provided with insightful deliverables such that 50% of engagements lead to add-on, follow-on, or referral work within 2 years.

Do you have a passion for understanding and developing network systems? Consider ESnet’s Research and Development team. ESnet’s mission is to accelerate science by delivering unparalleled networking capabilities, tools, and innovations. ESnet interconnects the US National Laboratory system, is widely regarded as a technical pioneer, and is currently the fastest science network in the world. We are a dynamic organization, highly motivated and focused on results. We are working at the leading edge of software-defined networking, network knowledge plane, dynamic network infrastructure, network visualization, network knowledge plane, multi-domain and multi-layer architectures, deep learning, etc. The successful student will be the one who brings strong and diverse coding skills and is very self-motivated.

  


**Project One**


**Title:** ImprovingNetwork Observability


**Term:** Summer 2024


**Required skills:** Computer Networking familiarity, Python or comparable programming language, Data Collector Tools (Telegraf, Logstash, or comparable), Grafana or similar visualization systems, Elasticsearch or similar NoSQL databases, Machine Learning (optional)


**Abstract:**



ESnet maintains several tools that collect extensive amounts of data about the state of its network. We store this collected data along with metadata in a database, which is used to drive a wide range of reports, visualizations, and dashboards for use both internally and externally. We are looking to expand the capabilities of these systems to enable new possibilities for our users.

  



This internship will focus on assisting ESnet developers in exploring and implementing new capabilities in data collection and analysis. Examples include but are not limited to - conversion of SNMP polling to streaming telemetry, machine learning of datasets to discover and alert on anomalies, adapting current ESnet data collection components to open source as part of the newly formed metrANOVA project, and integration of entirely new internal datasets. An effort will be made to align the candidates' interests and capabilities with the project.

  



**Project Two**


**Title:** Network Orchestration with Clixon


**Term:** Summer 2024


**Required skills:** Client-Server model concepts and REST APl; Linux / MacOS; git and gitlab; Python, Java, or C


**Abstract:**



Network Orchestration is a crucial component for Wide Area Network (WAN) providers like ESnet to manage an increased amount of networking devices and enhance the overall robustness of the network. It also decreases the deployment time of new networking equipment and helps significantly to reduce the configuration complexity. This project is about gathering some hands-on experiences in network orchestration by leveraging a combination of different open-source tools. One of the objectives is to develop a very basic workflow to e.g. configure a loopback interface on a router. Another potential outcome of this project would be a feature and implementation comparison with ESnet’s pre-existing services which are currently based on a proprietary platform, as well as the required steps and changes to move to an open-source product.

  


**Project Three**


**Title:** ESnet Figma Design System


**Term:** Summer 2024


**Required skills:**


* Visual and communication design principles including typography, iconography, color theory, and grid systems with experience crafting for multiple web platforms.
* Familiarity with Figma, Sketch, Adobe Creative Suite, or comparable design software.


**Desired skills:**


* An understanding of responsive design and how to apply mobile-first responsive strategies in design tooling such as Figma, Sketch, or Adobe Creative Suite.
* Familiarity with designing, maintaining, and scaling, new components, tokens, and elements in an existing design system
* We desire applicants to have a well-structured reviewable portfolio website
* Familiarity with accessibility design


**Abstract:**  

ESnet is developing its design system to be used across its product portfolio. A design system is a pattern for handling the common look and feel of user interfaces at scale. They enable organizations to develop frontend solutions at a higher velocity with a more consistent output. This is a high-visibility project where the designer will have touchpoints with multiple groups across the organization. The end product will have high public visibility.

  



The scope of this internship is to assist in designing components by delivering low-fidelity wireframes and high-fidelity visual comps. The ideal candidate will also assist with crafting the documentation for these new components and assist with hand off to developers.

  


**Project Four**


**Title:** Streamlining Deployment Workflow for Globus Data Transfer Sites with Ansible

**Abstract:**



The ESnet Communications & Multimedia Internship will offer both an overview of strategic external and internal communications at a cutting-edge scientific networking organization and offer hands-on experience in scientific storytelling for different audiences, through assisting with Web features, press releases, internal newsletters, and social media, and supporting a complex website migration project. The summer intern will also be entrusted with creating several short videos, from “Why I Like Working for ESnet” staff testimonials to explainer-type videos that focus on ESnet’s innovative applied-research products and services.

  


**Project Six**:


**Title:** Network Performance Prediction with Foundation Models


**Term:** Summer 2024


**Required skills:**


* Expert with foundation modeling
* Willing to learn about network performance prediction
* Proficient in written communication
* Proficient in Python programming


**Abstract:**



A research group led by Professor Arpit Gupta from UCSB has been interacting with ESnet management on exploring topics of automating some routine operations of ESnet. In particular, a summer project has been established to understand the possibility of applying the foundation model the UCSB team has developed for network traffic prediction. This task might provide helpful information for managing



expected high volumes of traffic on some backbone links operated by ESnet. The advantage of the foundation models is that they could systematically reduce the dependency on labeled data that are hard to



come by for use cases involving unusually large volumes of traffic on a link. The UCSB team has demonstrated successful use cases involving a campus network, we are interested in validating the approach for network backbone operated by ESnet.

  


**Project Seven**


**Title:** Machine Learning for Identification of REE-CM Hot Zones


**Term:** Summer 2024


**Required skills:**


* Expert with machine learning tools
* Willing to learn about classification problems involving gamma-ray detection data
* Proficient in written communication
* Proficient in Python programming


**Abstract:**



Characterization of Rare Earth Elements and Critical Minerals (REE-CM) in unconventional and secondary sources is a complex task that needs to overcome the challenges of detecting low and variable concentrations and the uniqueness of every source material deposit in terms of composition, host



material, and disposal environment. Like in traditional mineral prospecting, delineation of the REE-CM “hot zones” is critical for assessing the economic viability of these sources. Here, a hot zone is defined as a spatially delineated volume of high REE-CM concentrations within the tailing deposits.

  



We propose a machine learning (ML)-aided multi-physics approach for rapid identification and characterization of REE-CM hot zones in mine tailings for efficient recovery with a focus on coal and sulfide mine tailings and other processing or utilization byproducts, such as fly ash and refuse deposits.



This proposed multi-physics approach integrates a range of advanced and novel geophysical, radiological, and optical technologies deployed on aerial and surface platforms suitable for REE-CM prospecting. Aided by multiple existing and emerging core and lab analytical technologies, this integrated



approach provides a cross-scale capability from whole tailing REE-CM hot zone identification down to mineralogical and REE-CM characterization and quantification. Advanced ML capabilities are key to integrating these multi-physics datasets for identifying hot zones and optimizing sensing technology deployment. Feature engineering ML joined with federated learning and transfer learning will be used for data organization, feature extraction, and privacy protection.

  



**As part of the application process, please submit a statement explaining which project you prefer to apply to.**

  


**Notes:**


* The Summer 2024 Term is 12 weeks (6/3/2024 - 8/26/2024). Student participation requires 40 hours per week for Summer appointments. A ""late start"" date can be considered for academic reasons.
* The student assistant appointment can be renewed based on satisfactory job performance, continuing availability of funds, and ongoing operational needs.

**About the Tribal Program**  

Since 2010, GRID Alternatives’ has worked with tribal communities across the United States to support their renewable energy goals and visions for a sustainable future through tribal focused programs. The Tribal Program supports tribes in asserting control over their energy resources and focuses on making project implementation feasible by leveraging state and federal programs, philanthropic dollars, and partnerships with other tribes across Indian County while working in alignment to identify, develop, finance and implement solar power projects that meet community needs, including education, hands-on training, and energy cost reductions for tribal members.  

  

Since 2018, the Tribal Solar Accelerator Fund (TSAF) , a tribal-led grantmaking program, has partnered with 85+ tribes and 50+ tribal individuals to support renewable energy development, workforce and training, and leadership development goals. The TSAF has provided tribes with access to philanthropic capital through competitive grantmaking and leadership development programs. At its core, TSAF is about more than just regranting; it’s about mobilizing and developing tribal solar projects and integrating workforce development and training, nation-building, and strengthening the energy resilience of tribal communities with visions for a clean energy outlook for generations to come. The upfront expenses to install and maintain solar systems are out of reach for many tribal communities, which is why TSAF funding has been critical to each grantee we have supported.

**What Makes Cloudflare Special?**



We're not just a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company. We're a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company with a soul. Fundamental to our mission to help build a better Internet is protecting the free and open Internet.


**Project Galileo**: We equip politically and artistically important organizations and journalists with powerful tools to defend themselves against attacks that would otherwise censor their work, technology already used by Cloudflare's enterprise customers-at no cost.


**Athenian Project**: We created Athenian Project to ensure that state and local governments have the highest level of protection and reliability for free, so that their constituents have access to election information and voter registration.


**Path Forward Partnership**: Since 2016, we have partnered with Path Forward, a nonprofit organization, to create 16-week positions for mid-career professionals who want to get back to the workplace after taking time off to care for a child, parent, or loved one.


**1.1.1.1**: We released 1.1.1.1 to help fix the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy-centric public DNS resolver. This is available publicly for everyone to use - it is the first consumer-focused service Cloudflare has ever released. Here's the deal - we don't store client IP addresses never, ever. We will continue to abide by our privacy commitment and ensure that no user data is sold to advertisers or used to target consumers.

**Solutions Architect**

***(This position is hybrid and required to work 2 days a week in the Denton Texas Support Center)***


Our commitments are to build a truly diverse and inclusive company, care for our customers, people, and planet, and outperform together.

**Essential Function**


The solutions architect is accountable for proactively and holistically leading or supporting EA activities for creating deliverables that guide the developing direction for managing a portfolio of solutions in response to disruptive forces, and driving achieving targeted business outcomes. Solutions include systems (including applications, technologies, processes and information), shared infrastructure services and shared application services.


Solutions architects provide the necessary leadership, analysis and design tasks related to the development of an enterprise's solutions architecture. This individual creates deliverables that help develop a direction for managing the organization's portfolio of ""to be"" and ""as is"" solutions — including systems (meaning not just applications, but also processes and information), shared infrastructure services, and shared application services and components to better match targeted business outcome objectives. Solutions architecture is sometimes used interchangeably with applications and infrastructure architecture. However, both aforementioned typically fall under the purview of the solutions architect.


Application architecture is a subset of solutions architecture. It's the discipline that guides application design and defines application architecture paradigms, such as service-oriented architecture (SOA), principles that influence design decisions and patterns that provide proven design solutions.


Solutions architects leverage and use technology solutions to enable the organization's future-state business capabilities that, in turn, drive the organization's targeted outcomes. They facilitate and orchestrate the delivery of targeted business outcomes.

**Primary Duties**

* Understand business drivers and business capabilities (future and current state), and determine corresponding enterprise system designs and change requirements to drive the organization's targeted business outcomes.
* Design and lead the implementation of a solutions architecture across a group of specific business applications or technologies based on enterprise business strategy, business capabilities and business requirements.
* Manage and develop the architecture for a broader scope of projects, working closely with application architects that manage and design architecture for a single project or initiative.
* Provide consulting support to application architects within projects to ensure the project is aligned with the overall enterprise architecture.
* Monitor the current-state solution portfolio to identify deficiencies through aging of the technologies used by the application, or misalignment with business requirements.
* Understand technology trends and the practical application of existing, new, and emerging technologies to enable new and evolving business and operating models.
* Understand, advocate and augment the principles of information technology strategies.
* Analyze the business-IT environment (run, grow and transform the business) to detect critical deficiencies, and recommend solutions for improvement (systems of record, differentiation and innovation).
* Analyze the technology industry, competitors and market trends, and determine their potential impact on the enterprise.
* Define the principles, guidelines, standards and solution patterns to ensure solution decisions are aligned with the enterprise's future-state architecture vision.
* Design and direct the governance activities associated with ensuring solutions architecture assurance and compliance.
* Develop a roadmap for the evolution of the enterprise application portfolio from future to current state (as defined by the solutions architecture).
* Facilitate the evaluation and selection of software product standards and services, as well as the design of standard and custom software configurations.
* Consult with application and infrastructure development projects to fit systems or infrastructure to architecture and identify when it is necessary to modify projects to accommodate the solutions architecture.
* Identify the organizational impact (for example, on skills, processes, structures or culture) and financial impact of the solutions architecture.
* Document all solution architecture design and analysis work.
* Work closely with the program management office (PMO) or project management office to ensure the execution of plans corresponds with what is being promised.

**Credentials and Experience**

* Bachelor's degree in computer science, system analysis or a related study, or equivalent experience
* Minimum of five years of experience in at least two IT solution development disciplines, including technical architecture, network management, application development, middleware, database management or operations
* Exposure to multiple, diverse technologies and processing environments
* Good understanding of strategic and new and emerging technology trends, and the practical application of existing, new and emerging technologies to new and evolving business and operating models
* Understanding of agile methods and processes, and capability of supporting agile project teams by providing advice and guidance on opportunities, impact and risks, taking account of technical and architectural debt

**Skills**

* Exceptional interpersonal skills, including teamwork, facilitation and negotiation
* Strong leadership skills
* Excellent analytical and technical skills
* Excellent written and verbal communication skills
* Excellent planning and organizational skills
* Knowledge of all components of an enterprise technical architecture
* Knowledge of financial models and budgeting
* Excellent understanding of application development methodologies and infrastructure and network architecture
* Ability to work with developers in an in-and-out outsourced environment

**Competencies**

* Organizationally savvy, with a good understanding of the enterprise's political climate and how to navigate, influence and persuade political waters
* Ability to communicate, influence and persuade peers
* Ability to understand the long-term (""big picture"") and short-term perspectives of situations
* Ability to translate future-state business capabilities and requirements into solution architecture requirements
* Ability to propose and estimate the financial impact of solution architecture alternatives
* Ability to apply multiple technical solutions to business problems
* Ability to quickly comprehend the functions and capabilities of new technologies
* Proven ability to work well with others

**Characteristics**

* A respected leader
* Technology neutral: remains unbiased toward any specific technology or vendor choice, and is more interested in results than personal preferences
* Displays intellectual curiosity and integrity
* Motivated and driven by achieving long-term business outcomes

**Benefits**


We offer a competitive salary and outstanding benefits package that includes medical, dental, vision, life Insurance, paid vacation and sick days, paid holidays, tuition reimbursement and 401(k) with company match. In addition, associates of SBH may take advantage of our in house salon with complementary services and a varied selection of food options at our corporate campus.
