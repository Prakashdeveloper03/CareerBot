We are looking for a Software Engineer II with experience in iOS and Android for our Mobile Platform team — in our San Francisco office or remotely. Our team owns the shared iOS component library, our build and deployment processes, other third-party SDK integrations, and our Android app. The work we do serves our clients by prioritizing accessibility, app performance, and a consistent user experience. We multiply the efforts of other iOS teams by maintaining a strong platform for other engineers, and continuously improving the developer experience in our app so that feature engineers can do better work, faster.



You will deliver solutions—not just features—by developing an understanding of how Stitch Fix works. We trust you to focus your time and efforts where they are needed most. Your commitment to applying technology to business challenges in clean & innovative ways will make you a trusted advisor to your partners and their teams.

About Us  

Netflix is transforming how people enjoy TV shows, movies, live events, and games. While we already serve 260 million members across 190 countries, our major growth phase is still to come. Our team develops the TV, web, and mobile applications members use to discover and enjoy great entertainment. Our purpose is to increase member satisfaction by proving our product ideas through creativity and analytical thinking. Achieving this requires skilled, inquisitive technologists who can envision and implement solutions that scale across various devices and ambitious product features.  

Job Overview  

The Netflix app should provide an elevated and delightful experience: quick to open, highly responsive to user input, animate smoothly, have a low error rate and easy recovery when they do happen, visually elevated, and accessible by a broad user base from around the world.  

We are looking for engineers with experience in creating consumer apps for the web or TV to join us in elevating the quality of our TV app. More than 70% of all Netflix viewing happens on TV so your impact would be substantial. Using standard web technologies with our custom browser gives us unique performance and graphics capabilities that make it possible to craft a single Netflix application that scales across hundreds of TV devices.

* Bring creativity: collaborate with other engineering teams to evolve our custom browser or cloud infrastructure to unlock your work
* Partner: collaborate with product and design to strike healthy tradeoffs
* Enhance our culture: be a great role model and active agent in improving our unique culture
**Why work at Netflix**
-----------------------

* Make an Impact: Develop products that deliver top TV shows and movies to over 260 million customers worldwide
* High Performance: Collaborate with outstanding talent on each project
* Growth: Enjoy opportunities for personal and professional learning and mentorship
* Freedom and Responsibility: Proactively improve Netflix, even without explicit permission
**About You**
-------------

* You’ve worked on consumer-facing client applications (e.g., web, mobile, or TV) and are proficient in TypeScript/JavaScript
* You demonstrate user experience insights and have a usability and accessibility perspective
* You know performance optimization techniques for client applications
* You’re unafraid to take on new challenges and learn quickly to be effective in a new domain
* You can run with ambiguous requirements, be decisive when appropriate, and take smart risks
* You’re proactive and results-oriented
* You communicate and collaborate effectively and can advocate for controversial positions
  

At Netflix, we have found that diversity of thought and background builds stronger teams, leading to superior results.  

Our compensation solely consists of an annual salary without bonuses. You're free to choose your ratio of salary and stock options each year. Your compensation in the market range is based on market indicators, including your specific job family, background, skills, and experience. The range for this role is $$100,000 - $720,000.

--------------


We exist to make investing in the private markets as easy as Robinhood did for public stocks. More and more people invest in private equity and venture capital every day. Even though this asset class has been around for decades, it wasn't built to handle this volume of investors. Signing up for Robinhood? It takes two minutes. Investing in a VC fund? You've got to fill out a 200-question questionnaire each time that you make an investment. The forms aren't standardized and not every question applies to every investor. Investors miss questions or answer the wrong ones and then have to redo the entire thing.


We built a TurboTax-style workflow for investors to only see the questions that matter to them and see every question that matters to them to make fund closing (i.e. the process of investing into a VC fund) easy. Our world record document completion time is two minutes.


That may sound boring but we've processed billions of dollars for thousands of investors. And by having an investor run through our workflow, we capture their identity so we can allow them to repurpose it wherever they'd like in the future. We call this an ""investor passport"" and it's the whole reason we built this business. This is the first fund workflow that we're automating.

**The problems you’ll solve**
-----------------------------


At Passthrough, you’ll do more than simply coding and following directions. Since we’re an early stage startup, there’s plenty of opportunity to influence design and direction. We’re tackling complex projects without easy answers, like creating the investor passport from above. What kind of data is reusable, how do we store it, how should we present it to investors, what permissions need to exist? You need to approach the problem from at least technical, product, security, and visual perspectives.


All of our employees and clients constantly generate new product ideas as a collaborative effort, allowing you to take on tasks outside of strictly engineering.


You’ll develop a deep understanding of the whole product and technology stack. Each engineer has a unique role in the company. Regardless of what your experience is or where your career interests lie, we’ll cooperatively tailor a path that aligns with your goals and ours. As the company is changing quickly and you’re exploring your interests, we will adjust this trajectory frequently based on regular check-ins so your role is dynamic and evolving with us.

**Technologies we use**
-----------------------

* React
* Django/Django REST
* Google Cloud Platform
* Python
* Enterprise APIs, such as Docusign and Sendgrid

**The team you’ll work with**
-----------------------------


The engineering team is currently a close-knit group of 5 that are a mix of NYC-based and remote. The team consists of former Google and Carta employees. We know how to build engineering, product, and revenue generating businesses in this space. We’re fast paced and highly collaborative. Engineers play a critical role in product decisions and work closely with the founders and all departments. We work in week-long sprints, where we decide which projects the team should focus on and which projects we personally would like to work on. This gives us all autonomy to direct our day-to-day tasks in addition to our larger career goals.

**Qualifications**
------------------

*Required*

* Python
* Proficiency in React or expert in equivalent frontend framework
* Proficiency in Django or expert in equivalent web frameworks
* Familiarity with SQL
* Ability to learn and adapt quickly
* Comfort with ambiguity in a fast-growing startup

*Desired*

* Clear, concise communication skills
* Enthusiasm to be stretched beyond a standard software engineering role
* Interest or experience in financial or wealth tech

**What to expect in the hiring process**
----------------------------------------


We go through the same interview steps for all engineers to ensure equity in our hiring process. All roles also require a background check.


Our process is designed to learn as much about each candidate as possible, as well as to give candidates access to our team and learn about what it's like to work at Passthrough.

* Initial screen: Have a quick 20-30 minute chat with the team to learn more about each other
* Technical screen: Have an 45 minute technical screen where you'll be asked a coding question over Google Docs
* Onsite Interview: 2-3 45-minute technical screens with our co-founder Alex and others from the engineering team. This should be a familiar process if you've interviewed at a company like Google. Those screens will be followed up by 2 separate 30-minute meetings with the other co-founders, Tim and Ben.
* Get a decision: We'll get back to you within a week on what's next

Quiet is a free software, peer-to-peer alternative to Slack and Discord. We’re building it because we believe most Internet users will only escape Big Tech and “the cloud” once free software can connect the devices they control (their phones, their laptops) to provide full-featured online spaces for work and community life, with no server required.

We’re hiring a senior software engineer to help us prove that using free software for communication and collaboration doesn’t need to mean trusting someone else’s server or running one’s own.

It’s an exciting time for peer-to-peer communication tools; they aren’t pipe dreams anymore! Tools like IPFS, libp2p, [CRDTs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free\\_replicated\\_data\\_type) like Automerge, and overlay networks like Tor do a lot of the heavy lifting, making it easier for teams to focus on the mix of features, reliability, and security properties real users need.

We think Quiet is the farthest along among comparable projects, but there’s still a ton of work to be done. Quiet has working releases for desktop and Android, and iOS is very close. We use Quiet internally for our team chat, but we have tricky reliability improvements to make—as well as a ton of features to build—before most real teams or communities could use Quiet daily as a Slack substitute.

Your role will be to help us move surefooted, with urgency, through features and stack-level challenges.

**About you**

* 5+ years of experience delivering user-facing software in a high-stakes setting
* Experienced delivering software products for desktop and/or mobile
* Can mentor and guide other engineers
* Prepared to contribute immediately to our Electron, React, React Native, Node.js, TypeScript project. (We use React Native with a Node.js backend on mobile.)
* Familiar with test-driven development; ready to work with tools like Jest, React Testing Library, Chromatic, Cypress, and WebDriver
* Ready to assess new tools and research in the peer-to-peer, local-first space for applicability to challenges we face
* Experienced enough with how software projects play out over time to help us navigate risk and scope for the long term
* Ready to work in US or European time zones

**Not required, but a plus**

* Experience with peer-to-peer or local-first software
* Experience with security
* Experience building high-availability web apps at scale
* Expertise in one of the technologies we build on: Tor, IPFS, libp2p, or distributed databases, and readiness to become an expert in the others
* Contributions to one of these projects, or a similar project

**What we offer**

* 100% remote with regular in-person retreats and meetings
* An option of in-person work in the northeast U.S.
* Salary $60-$160k depending on experience
* Equity
* Unlimited PTO

*Quiet is an equal opportunity employer. All applicants will be considered for employment regardless of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, veteran or disability status. We believe that a diverse staff enables us to better understand and serve our users, and the world. We encourage people subject to systemic bias to apply, including people of color, indigenous people, LGBTQIA+ people, women, and any other person who is part of a group that is underrepresented in tech. We understand some may not feel comfortable applying if they don't check all the above boxes. We value motivated candidates who can learn as they go, so if you're in doubt, please apply!*

In today's environment, sales teams need to have a tremendous amount of information about their prospects to decide when is the best moment and channel to reach out in the most relevant way. You can't do this with 5 different data/sales enablement point solutions that don't share the same data schema and barely communicate with each other. Amplemarket is the all-in-one compound solution that enables this.
  
Our AI-powered sales platform helps B2B companies generate more opportunities thanks to our advanced lead generation engine, hyper-personalized sequencing, omnichannel outreach, and AI-powered smart actions. We are backed by Y Combinator, and we are powering the sales teams at some of the fastest-growing companies in the world like Deel, Moveworks, H1 and Vanta.
  
  

Are you up for a challenge? Amplemarket welcomes spontaneous applications from talented people who are eager to join our team.
  
  

We are always on the lookout for exceptional Frontend Engineers who want to revolutionize the future of sales, while thriving in an incredible Engineering environment.
  
  

While we may not be prioritizing this opening at the moment - and, therefore, might take a bit longer to get back to you - we review spontaneous applications regularly and if your profile stands out, we’ll definitely want to get to know you
  
  

Frontend engineers build the interface that connects people to Amplemarket.
  
The three co-founders have an engineering background (João, Luís and Mica studied Physics & Computer Science at university) and deeply value the work that engineers are responsible for.
  
Our main goal is to build a sales platform that helps companies grow. Our product requires us to solve a myriad of difficult engineering problems very diverse in nature: from working on NLP models that can extract information from a thread of emails to scaling an elasticsearch cluster holding terabytes of data.
  
We are deeply aware of the importance of our tool to our customers and look for people that share that vision.
  
  

**Among other things, our stack includes:**  

Ruby on Rails, React, PostgresQL, Elasticsearch, Redis
  
We don't require you to have experience in our stack to apply.
  
  

Our customers use Amplemarket on a daily basis. We turn TB of data easily accessible through great UIs. We empower our users to engage with their prospects in the most personalized way. Luckily, you are reading this, and when you join Amplemarket will have even more jaw-dropping features.
  
As an early member of the engineering team, you will build new user experiences and product features that are critical to our customers. You will work cross-functionally in a fullstack team and in close collaboration with product, design, customer success, support, and sales functions.
  
  

**You will:**

Security
Netflix is the world's leading streaming entertainment service with 200+ million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, documentaries, and feature films across a wide variety of genres and languages. This is made possible, in part, by an engineering organization that enables our customers to stream content and our studio to produce content.  

The Security Services Engineering organization supports the Netflix workforce by creating and operating authentication, authorization, and cryptographic software services. Our IAM use cases will continue to become more complex as we increase investment in Netflix Originals content production ecosystems, including Gaming. Our workforce and partners are global, and they access our information with different patterns from a variety of locations and devices. With security and ease of information access for our fast-paced growth in mind, we realize that the traditional corporate network security perimeter no longer meets our requirements. Instead, we invest in Identity as a perimeter in the open internet, with reliable and strong authentication and authorization service to protect our information.  

The Role
This role is a unique opportunity to contribute to architecting and building identity and access security services and solutions! You will be part of the Identity Integrations and Solutions Engineering (IISE) team, focusing on core Identity Lifecycle Management, Consultation and Solutions to support all of the Netflix ecosystem (Enterprise, Studio and Gaming). You will play a critical role in security function with experience in software engineering including Identity system and solutions design, implementation, partner integration, and rollout strategy for some of our foundational services and IAM solution which includes but is not limited to fine grain access controls, policy driven security, identity governance, access management, privileged access management, user provisioning/deprovisioning, and federation.
If you are curious about some of the team’s work, you can watch this Building Identity for an Open Perimeter conference talk by our IAM engineers. Another recommended read is this blog post about how product and application security operates in the Netflix culture.**What you’ll need to be successful:**

* Experience working with authentication and authorization protocols/frameworks (OpenID Connect, SCIM, OAuth, SAML, AD/LDAP, Federation, SSO).
* Experience designing, building and or operating complex Access Models by making informed decisions using deep understanding of industry standards such as RBAC/ABAC/PBAC etc.
* You believe in risk focused, scalable security approaches with a strong technical background in developing and maintaining low latency, high resiliency, and high-availability, services.
* In-depth experience in at least one modern programming language such as Java (preferred) or Python and mastery of object-oriented design and programming.
* You prefer collaboration and problem solving over process and mandates and are also comfortable dealing with ambiguity and independent decision making.
* You have excellent verbal and written communication skills and a product focused mindset to build the right solutions and extensive documentation for your stakeholders and customers.
**Nice to have:**
-----------------

* Experience running services on top of a Cloud computing platform (e.g., AWS, Microsoft Azure, GCP)
* Experience in continuous integration and continuous deployment in a Cloud platform
* Experience with NoSQL technologies such as Hive, Presto, Spark, or Cassandra

Our customers are passionate about our mission, which has led to incredibly strong repeat metrics and one of the highest NPS scores in the industry (85+). We are laser-focused on building a strong, sustainable and profitable (!!) business, and hiring the best people to help us get there.  

Our company values kind and thoughtful self-starters who can think strategically and then work collaboratively with people across the organization to produce high-quality outcomes. We are also a very change-friendly group of people, and are always seeking fresh points of view to uncover ways we can improve our products, processes and team culture. **Full-Time Employee Benefits:*** 4-day workweek: Fridays are flexible at Primary to allow you to manage your work-life balance

In this role, you’ll work on both internal tools as well as customer-facing features - an entire feature often includes both.

The role is 100% remote and can be based anywhere in the US.

* You are pragmatic - you put the customer first and strike a strong balance building the best possible customer experiences within engineering constraints. You're able to lead architecture discussions and make decisions based on this pragmatism.
* You believe that good product development depends on diversity, collaboration, communication, and empathy.
* You believe that accessibility should be baked in from the start, and you are familiar with accessibility best practices.
* When not in collaboration mode, you're a self-starter who is able to work independently in a remote environment. You are comfortable owning, and executing on, tasks and projects from start to finish.
* You believe in blameless culture and assume positive intent - we’re all doing the best we can, given the resources we have.
* You can quickly pick up on new environments and are comfortable switching languages/contexts on a daily basis.

### **We're looking for someone who:**

* Is comfortable working across the stack and working in a variety of contexts - we use React, Typescript, GraphQL, Jest, Remix, Liquid, CSS/SCSS, and Ruby on Rails.
* Has experience working with a cloud/serverless architecture - we use a mix of Cloudflare workers, AWS Lambdas, and EventBus.
* Has experience with e-commerce, apparel, and/or Shopify.
* Has experience working collaboratively with designers and product managers to come up with optimal solutions based on both requirements and reality.

### **WHO WE ARE**



Each year U.S. households spend over $3.8 trillion - about one third of all consumer spending - on recurring bill payments. While staying on top of these bills is the single largest determinant for consumer financial health, organizing and paying them can be a time-consuming and frustrating chore. Since its inception, doxo has been on a mission to simplify and reduce the anxiety of staying on top of bills, empowering consumers to improve their financial health. Our company was founded on the simple idea that there should be an easy and more secure way for consumers to pay all of their bills through a single account, with any payment method, on any device.

To date, over eight million doxo users across 97% of U.S. zip codes have paid bills through the payment network, across more than 45 different service categories. With more than 120,000 payable billers, doxo's proprietary, crowd sourced provider directory is the largest in the nation.



doxo is consistently recognized as both an innovative company and a great place to work by the likes of Inc. Magazine, Deloitte, Comparably, and BuiltIn. Come join us as we grow the team to further accelerate growth, forever changing the bill pay landscape to focus on the customer.


### **WHY WE ARE DIFFERENT**



doxo is unique in that we have already found product/market fit and that our service is filling an important market need every day.

Because transparency is a priority at all levels across the organization, we are all aware of how our work contributes to the success of our business as a whole. We are agile and work hard to solve difficult problems quickly. We work as a team to get things done and mentor individuals to get to the next level in their career.

Canopy AI (parent company of CollegeVine) is the world's fastest-growing guidance company. Our mission is to bring lifelong guidance to the next generation. Ivy, our AI-powered mentor and superconnector, presents students with timely advice, acts as a sounding board, and surfaces valuable real-world networking opportunities that can change life outcomes. Trusted by millions and counting for guidance on their professional journeys, we are growing quickly in both adoption and revenue. If you want to apply your skills to a unique and consequential mission, we invite you to write the next chapter of your career alongside talented and exceptional teammates at Canopy AI!


**About the role:**



As Canopy AI scales, we're looking to add talented engineers focused on solving real-world problems to help us build new products and scale our existing systems. Canopy AI's engineering team expects each engineer to own their work from idea into production, with focus on learning as quickly as possible. This means small batches, CI/CD, deploying to production multiple times per-day, and rapid iteration as our ideas become reality for our customers.



You'll work on a product squad alongside designers, domain experts, and other engineers to solve the correct problems and deliver our guidance technology in a safe and reliable way.



This role is fully remote.


**Responsibilities:**


* Own and rapidly deliver features across the full stack in partnership with your lead engineer
* Own problems end-to-end, and are willing to pick up whatever knowledge you're missing to get the job done
* Partner directly with functions across the business to understand their needs
* Improve engineering productivity for yourself and other engineers by creating tooling, documentation, and (of course) automated tests
* Focus on solving the problems at hand, not just writing code (although that's typically how Canopy AI delivers solutions)


**Requirements:**


* 3+ years of software engineering experience (including internships)
* Proficiency with relational databases, modern IasS platforms, (Javascript || Ruby), and MVC web frameworks like Ruby on Rails. We also make heavy use of Purescript, so experience or an interest in learning typed-functional programming is necessary.
* You see yourself first and foremost as a pragmatic problem solver who just happens to write code
* Have a humble attitude, a love for learning, an eagerness to help your colleagues, and a desire to do whatever it takes to make the team succeed
* Care deeply about the end user experience and take pride in building products to solve customer needs


Canopy AI was originally founded in 2013 in Cambridge, MA as Admissions Hero (later CollegeVine) and reaches over 20 million families annually in search of guidance. Our roots are in delivering near-peer mentorship at scale, which has since evolved to delivering lifelong guidance through AI and a vast professional network. We have raised over $66m in venture funding from dedicated investors such as Morningside Technology Ventures (Xiaomi, TikTok), the founding partner of 5Y Capital, Fidelity, University Ventures, and more. In 2020, after years of being a remote-friendly company, Canopy became a fully remote company centered on Eastern Time with a diverse cast of team members based predominantly in the United States, but also around the world."
