**ABOUT THIS OPPORTUNITY:****Kruze Consulting** provides accounting, bookkeeping, finance, payroll, and tax services to over 800 startups backed by top-tier venture capital funds. The ***Senior Financial Analyst*** is instrumental in advising startup founders on their financial strategy and fundraising efforts. In this role, you will work closely with founders and executives, serving as a strategic partner to help them make informed financial decisions. The Senior Financial Analyst is responsible for developing accurate financial projections and managing budgets to help our clients understand and navigate their financial landscapes. While there is a lot of financial modeling and forecasting in this role, it’s also about providing practical insights that give founders the understanding they need to improve their operations and achieve their growth and fundraising goals.
**KRUZE CONSULTING IS AN EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY EMPLOYER.**
Kruze Consulting believes in diversity of thought as a competitive advantage to bring people together to build a culturally inclusive team. If you are smart, and good at what you do, come as you are. Diverse candidates (however you choose or choose not to identify) are encouraged to apply.

Our experience shows that remote work fosters a healthier work/life balance for our people. We do get together once a year for an annual offsite meeting, but it’s optional.
* ***Flexibility/Autonomy*** - Need to run to an appointment, your child's school, or just want to take a walk outside? No problem. If your clients’ needs are met and your work gets done on time, enjoy!
* ***Stability*** – While we serve startups, we aren’t one. We’ve been around for almost a decade enjoying controlled growth over that time. We don’t over-hire, and thankfully, we’ve never had to do a reduction in force. Our service offering is niche, accounting is essential to businesses, and the potential market for our services is diversified/vast.
* ***High-Quality Colleagues*** - We’re a diverse bunch, experts in our respective fields, and eager to help each other and clients. We care about each other as whole human beings.
* ***High-Quality Clients*** - We work exclusively with venture-funded technology startups and early-stage companies who are creating some of the most exciting and transformative products and services in the world! (We also have a “no jerks” policy; our clients treat our people professionally and respectfully.)
* **Purpose/Meaningful Work** – Not your average accounting role. Kruze professionals get to work with innovative startups that are disrupting their respective industries and creating the products and services of tomorrow. Like proud parents, we derive vicarious enjoyment as our clients grow, get additional rounds of funding, and ultimately get acquired by Fortune 500 firms.
* **Professional Development** – You’ll gain exposure to many types of clients and industries including SaaS, eCommerce, Healthcare, Biotech, Crypto/Blockchain, and Manufacturing. At Kruze, you’ll have the opportunity to learn multiple disciplines and work with a wide variety of high-visibility clients and find your passion.

* **Prioritizing** – excellent time management, able to frequently reprioritize and still meet deadlines
* **Multitasking** – able to manage multiple deliverables independently
* **Creative Problem Solving** – able to find solutions in ambiguous situations
* **Big Picture Perspective** – able to step back and see the big picture, don’t get lost in the details
* **Excellent Communication Skills** – fully fluent in verbal and written English
* **Managing Expectations** – know how and when to communicate changes in timelines and when to ask for help

**NICE TO HAVE/POSITION PREFERENCES:*** Progress towards a CFA® charter or completion of a financial modeling training program
* A thorough understanding of accounting principles and the application of these principles as they relate to technology companies
* Experience working with venture capital-backed private companies
* Experience with software, SaaS, tech-enabled services, or other recurring revenue business models

**WHAT YOU’LL BE DOING:*****Support clients in finance engagements (35-40 hours per week)**** Develop and maintain 3-statement financial models in Excel (25-30 hours per week)
* Provide advice, financial analysis, and client support

**WHAT YOU WON’T BE DOING:*** Kruze’s own corporate finance. That’s handled by our CFO.

**A note of caution about remote work at Kruze Consulting:**
While it seems cool, it’s not for everyone. You must have the discipline, work ethic, healthy boundaries, work strategies, and emotional intelligence to work remotely. While we strive for work-life balance at Kruze, this is still a fast-paced role that will require you to juggle many different projects and tasks. You must enjoy and thrive in this type of fast-paced environment.**A note of caution about this position:**
To be successful in this role specifically, it’s likely that you will need to put in longer hours than the typical 9 to 5. We anticipate that the workload for this person will average out to 45-50 hours per week, with about 30-40 hours of that being billable client work. There is no travel, so if you’re coming from investment banking, you might consider this a better work/life balance. We also know that these sorts of hours may not be a fit for everyone’s lifestyle/personal preferences, so we want to be transparent about our expectations.

Kruze Consulting has grown organically and rapidly, tripling in size over the last two years. We provide accounting, bookkeeping, finance, payroll, and tax services to over 800 startups backed by top-tier venture capital funds.* Kruze Consulting is a ***2023 Inc. 5000 Honoree*** *for the sixth year in a row*

**THE COMPANY**



B-Stock is the world's largest B2B recommerce marketplace for excess [or surplus] merchandise. Businesses of all sizes leverage the B-Stock platform to sell and buy customer returns, overstock and other excess merchandise - ranging from top brands and retailers who want best-in-class inventory management to entrepreneurs looking to source valuable merchandise for their resale businesses.



Tens of thousands of small business owners all over the globe use B-Stock to launch and power their resale business. We take pride in empowering these innovators and entrepreneurs of commerce.



In 2020 we sold 120 million items across our platform, giving a second life to this otherwise would be ""waste"" merchandise. In fact, we kept 400 million pounds of goods in use and saved millions from the landfill. It feels good to be B-Stock!



The amount of returned or unsold inventory continues to grow each year, and in 2020, it was estimated at over $1 trillion worth worldwide. We know there is tremendous value in and demand for this inventory - no matter the category, condition, or location. The B-Stock platform gives buyers a simple way to buy brand-name merchandise directly from top retailers and manufacturers. At the same time, we offer companies an automated, trusted replacement for traditional liquidation while boosting operational efficiency, recovery rates, and cycle time.



Led by eBay veterans and backed by top investors including Spectrum Equity, True Ventures, and Susquehanna Growth Equity, B-Stock shows no signs of slowing down. Our core values have shaped the company we are today and will continue to drive our success for many years to come.

**OUR VALUES**  

  

***Make Each Dollar Count***  

Whether it's the recovery amount or a buyer's budget, money matters to all of our clients. And because each dollar matters to them, it matters to us.


***Take Our Work Seriously, Not Ourselves***  

Everything at B-Stock continues to grow - everything but our egos, that is. We're not afraid to let loose and laugh (often at ourselves).


***Do The Hard Things Today That Will Pay Off Tomorrow***  

We're willing to sacrifice and endure, fail and adapt to reach our long-term goals.


***Use Trust As The Best Measure Of Success***  

The trust we earn along the way is more valuable than money. Without trust from both our buyers and sellers, our business won't succeed.


***Find Strength In Numbers***  

Use our passion for data to provide value to our customers, improve ourselves, and develop new ways to delight our buyers and sellers.  

  

*No applicant will face discrimination/harassment based on race, color, ancestry, national origin, religion, age, gender, marital domestic partner status, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability status, or veteran status. Above and beyond discrimination/harassment based on ""protected categories,"" B-Stock also strives to prevent other, subtler forms of inappropriate behavior (e.g., stereotyping) from ever gaining a foothold in our office. Whether blatant or hidden, barriers to success have no place at B-Stock.*
