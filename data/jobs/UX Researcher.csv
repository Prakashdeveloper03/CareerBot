If you're passionate about modernizing government websites and ready to make information more easily understandable to America’s business, we encourage you to apply.  

  

Some fine print. You will be working on a United States government platform, and they have a few basic requirements for contractors like ourselves. You must perform all work physically within the United States at all times. In addition, you must be a United States citizen and be able to pass a government-performed public trust background check.  

  

For People is an Equal Employment Opportunity employer. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetics, and/or veteran status.

**CAREER LEVEL: D**


Leverage technology to impact patients and ultimately save lives


Do you have expertise in, and passion for, information technology? Would you like to apply your expertise to impact the IT strategy in a company that follows the science and turns ideas into life changing medicines? If so, AstraZeneca might be the one for you!

**ABOUT ASTRAZENECA**


AstraZeneca is a global, science-led, patient-focused biopharmaceutical company that focuses on the discovery, development and commercialisation of prescription medicines for some of the world’s most serious disease. But we’re more than one of the world’s leading pharmaceutical companies. At AstraZeneca we’re dedicated to being a Great Place to Work.

**ABOUT OUR IT TEAM**


It’s a dynamic and results-oriented environment to work in – but that’s why we like it. There are countless opportunities to learn and grow, whether that’s exploring new technologies in hackathons, or redefining the roles and work of colleagues, forever. Shape your own path, with support all the way. Diverse minds that work cross- functionally and broadly together.

**ABOUT THE ROLE**


The UX team is currently made up of experts in UX Research, UX Design, UI/ Visual Design and Accessibility, across the UK (Cambridge, Macclesfield), US (Wilmington, DE; Gaithersburg, MD), India (Chennai), Mexico (Guadalajara), and China (Shanghai). We’re an empowered team, offering great opportunities and able to make a real difference to people’s lives.

 **Role Description**


The UX Designer/Researcher is responsible for using research to understand what users want/ need from digital products & services then using these insights to design products that are easy, safe, and delightful to use. These products and services will include both external (patient- and/or doctor-facing) and internal colleague-/scientist-facing tools, and cover a range of platforms (devices, websites, mobile apps, etc.). We are looking for someone who can own and run a full, end-to-end UCD process. Whilst you should have strong UX Design skills, ideally you should have a good working knowledge of UX research methodologies and be able to carry out user research/usability testing yourself when necessary.


Working by yourself or with a Researcher, you will use qualitative/ quantitative user research studies and/or analyse data from existing research. Ideally you will have experience with a range of user research methods including interviewing and observation. You will use the outputs of the research to inform the early design process; for example, creating personas or user journey maps.


Using the available insights, you will then design the product’s high-level UX (e.g. via flows and wireframes), plus lower-level interaction designs (e.g. via interactive prototypes) which unambiguously communicate the intended product experience. While visual design skills are a plus, our team’s focus is on maximum usability, not aesthetics.


You will iteratively improve your designs based on results from usability testing (carried out by yourself or others). You will work closely with technical developers during the build process to manage compromises and ensure the best possible UX is launched.


You will find ways to measure and prove the impact and value that your research and design interventions have made to the end user and/or the business


In order to make efficient use of our resources and ensure a consistent and learnable experience across products (when applicable), you will help to create design libraries where proven design patterns and interactions are documented for future reuse.


You will act as an advocate for users by ensuring that UX is kept top of mind throughout the design process. You will champion UX across the organization by helping senior Global stakeholders and project team members understand the value of UX, the User-Centred Design process and when/how to engage our team.

**Requirements (Technical)**

* A thorough understanding of UX principles from on-the-job experience
* Experience (typically 3+ years) as a UX Designer – ideally working either in or for large, client-side companies. Experience working in a global distributed organization preferred
* Experience across UX Research methodologies – e.g. interviews, surveys, usability testing, field trials – and how they fit into a full UCD process. (Direct experience moderating such research is preferred).
* Experience using research insights to make design decisions, and in creating strategic design documents such as Personas, User Journey Maps and Storyboards.
* Experience creating high-level information architectures, low-level flows and wireframes, interaction designs, interactive prototypes, etc.
* Experience with using Figma or similar tools for UX design and interactive prototyping
* A portfolio of case studies where good UCD has made a difference to the quality of digital products and services
* Experience designing products for multiple platforms and user groups
* Working knowledge of Accessibility/ Inclusive Design principals and guidelines – i.e. ensuring the best experience for all users, independent of their (dis)ability
  

Requirements (Soft Skills)

* A self-starter, not requiring hand-holding.
* An excellent listener, with the ability to quickly filter the relevant user insights for design
* An excellent presenter, succinctly imparting UX designs, with appropriate rationale, in both written and spoken formats, and in plain, non-technical language
* Great influencing skills, including the ability to evangelize UCD to stakeholders
* A great team player, able to work well as part of a small UX team and also collaborate closely with Product Managers, Business Analysts, Technical Developers, etc.
* Motivated to both give and receive constructive criticism on UX designs
* Able to successfully juggle the competing demands of multiple concurrent projects within a global corporate environment
* Must have excellent fluency in English- both verbal and written
 **WHY JOIN US?**


We’re a network of high-reaching self-starters who contribute to something far bigger. We enable AstraZeneca to perform at its peak by delivering premier technology and data solutions.


We’re not afraid to take ownership and run with it. Empowered with unrivalled freedom. Put simply, it’s because we make a significant impact. Everything we do matters.

The Supply Chain Management (SCM) team at Oracle is committed to creating a state-of-the-art consumer-grade end user experience across our portfolio of products, that will be *the* factor that distinguishes our software from the competition. Yes. We’re absolutely serious. And we can’t do it without your help. We need thoughtful, hard-working, multi-faceted user experience designers who love empowering technology users with high quality interaction and visual design to bring their creative ideas and their hard work to join our team.


Take a sneak peek at Oracle’s next gen user experience here: https://youtu.be/fc6tCZlEOVo


And our recent win at San Francisco Design Week here: https://lnkd.in/gPFyBTC  



**What you’ll do**

Supply Chain Management really should be named the Future of Making. It is widely known as the underlying tool that helps makers get their supplies from point A to point B, build their products, and deliver to their customers in the most efficient way possible. What’s new is how that process is becoming automated and more intelligent through smarter and more responsive technologies, AI and predictive analytics, virtual and augmented reality to help with diagnostics and breaking down location barriers, and IoT devices embedded into environments that monitor and assess processes and create intelligent distributed systems. And it’s not only traditional manufacturers who are looking for ways to get products to their customers faster, it’s also service-oriented businesses who look for ways to make their services faster and more reliable, bringing better value to their customers.


The future of making requires a powerful and flexible experience that works across many apps, across device types (such as mobile, desktop, IoT, and large displays) and that adjusts naturally and fluidly through different contexts. Yet our team isn’t just making it functional. We are making it beautiful. Imagine creating data visualizations that are not only easy to understand but also works of art? We are changing the paradigms and making our customers fall in love with us one interaction at a time.


In this role, you will work alongside the best of designers, product managers and technologists to design solutions that industries across the world use to design and run their supply chains. We are working on multiple ambitious new initiatives and your work will have direct impact on both the user experience and the industry as we work to redefine this space.


As a Principal Designer, your tasks and responsibilities will include:


* Discovering user needs and developing deep insights, generating concepts, and crafting solutions on how people will interact with the products we design.
* Framing and telling the story around your design solutions. Contribute to the communication of research findings, conceptual ideas, detailed design, and design rationale both verbally and visually.
* Independently create user journeys, wireframes, information architecture, user flow diagrams, high fidelity mockups and interactive prototypes to communicate designs; and iterate on designs based on feedback from collaborators and research.
* Leverage and consume user research data in the creation of UX deliverables.
* Present concepts and ideas to key collaborators, product and development teams to establish common understanding of the designs and gain agreement.
* Contribute to design specifications and help evolve our design systems.
* Work closely with development team to ensure the designs are accurately implemented.
Mentor junior designers on the team.  
* 

**Required qualifications and traits**

Here’s the kind of person we are looking for:


**You have 8+ years of experience –** You have worked as a designer for at-least 8 years, preferably, and have experience designing, building and delivering products


**You’re a full stack user experience designer.** You look at interaction design, visual design and aesthetics, typography, motion, 3D, human factors, and more as tools in the UX designer’s toolkit. You may be better at some than others, but you know how to talk about each and combine them all into an experience that delights **.**

**You thrive on working well with others.** You make the people around you better. You love to collaborate with designers, user researchers, engineers, product managers, executives, and inspire them to do their best.


**You get stuff done.**

**You’re a fantastic storyteller.** You know that our products tell our customers a story through the user experience. You won’t rest until that story is a compelling one.


**You love rules and you know when to break them.** You think systemically because you know that creating a coherent experience requires it. But you know when the system needs to expand to accommodate a user’s varied conceptual model. And you know when to do something completely unique to create an arresting and product-defining moment in the product that makes users ooh and aah.


**You don’t already know everything and you love to learn.** You’re inspired by helping users tackle their problems. You love finding out you’re wrong. You consume large amounts of quantitative and qualitative data to constantly refine your assumptions.


**And finally, you want to be part of creating dramatic and impactful change at a company that is committed to becoming a light unto others when it comes to user experience design.** You might have learned your craft via formal training or via on-the-job training. For most candidates, it’s a combination of both. As long as you’ve got experience and passion doing this work at the highest level, we’d love to talk to talk to you and see a portfolio of the work you’re most proud of.


* Your application must include links to an online portfolio/have offline version attached.
