Transitional Characters(TC) seeks healers who represent our core principles of bringing creativity, multidisciplinary interests, justice-focused, global, anti-racist practices, and a desire to grow toward a self-actualized life. This is not lip service. When we say we are a decolonial and liberation focused practice we walk the walk. We are Black woman owned and serious about getting free.

A clinical therapist candidate with confident therapeutic skills and a willingness to continue growing personally, professionally, and, most importantly, multidisciplinarily. We want people who geek out over history, identity, culture, psychedelics, bodywork, social justice, relationships, multi and interracial intersections, and creativity. Though not a necessity, a willingness to become licensed in the state of California. We will be opening an office there in 2025.

At TC, we provide psychotherapy to adults, teens, couples, groups, and families using evidence-based and ancestral therapeutic interventions such as but not limited to:

* Liberation Psychology
* Somatic Abolishionism
* Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)
* EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing)
* Somatic healing
* Psychoanalytic
* Psychodynamic (focused on the unconscious)
* Behavioral (focused on learning new behavior)
* Cognitive (focused on thought)
* Humanistic (focused on achieving potential)
* Integrative (fusing multiple modalities - ie. integrating movement etc. . . )
* Interest in Psychedelics more specifically, Psilocybin/Mushrooms and MDMA
* Evidence-Based Experiential Therapy

A deeply rooted understanding of Liberation Psychology and/or a commitment to learning. Ability to work with a diverse population under a liberation lens. Experience or training in trauma-informed care is necessary. Our work is focused on Identity Navigation™ for our clients (training will be provided). This is about a deep understanding of who one is, how we form our identities, and how living in and participating in a colonized country affects us individually and collectively.

TC is a new practice and you have the option to be a fully virtual clinician if you decide. If you desire a space to work in person, we can talk about this 1:1. Our group practice is based in Pittsburgh, PA, and specializes in providing identity-focused, modern, transparent (mostly) virtual therapy. We are positioning ourselves for a time when psychedelics become accessible in PA, and any therapist looking to provide integrative therapy is able to do so currently.

**The position is full-time (25+ hours ) or part-time (minimum of 15 hours) bases. If you require a different set up please explain in email.** 

We offer competitive rates, assistance with client referrals, and case consultations with experienced clinicians. We handle all the billing and marketing aspects of the business so that you can focus on what you do best - providing excellent clinical services to your clients. Employee or 1099 positions are available. We offer a multitude of ways to grow including teaching opportunities and niche clientele. Lots of training and support!

1 in 5 students has a learning disability such as dyslexia, which makes it harder for them to read, spell and write-despite their intelligence. While receiving a proper evaluation for a learning disability could be the most impactful event in a student's life, only 4% of students receive a diagnosis because of the high costs of evaluations and lack of access to qualified psychologists. Undiagnosed students are 3x more likely to drop out of high school, 5x more likely to be unemployed, and tend to experience elevated levels of anxiety and depression. It's estimated that early diagnosis of dyslexia and other learning disabilities could save the US over 72 billion dollars of economic impact and drastically improve the lives of millions of people.



Marker Learning is on a mission to make learning disability (e.g. dyslexia) assessments and diagnosis easier and more affordable for schools and parents. By leveraging proprietary technology developed by leading experts at Johns Hopkins, the end-to-end evaluation is completed in half the time and at 1/10th the cost of typical in person evaluations. We are a rapidly growing start up, backed by some of the most mission driven and reputable venture capital firms and education non-profits.

**This position requires the following:**


* Remotely administer academic and cognitive (e.g., WISC-V) assessments for Georgia school districts.
* Synthesize intake forms, behavioral observations, and evaluation results to develop a comprehensive report, including potential diagnoses and actionable recommendations.
* Follow company-wide processes to ensure reports are finished on time to meet your client's expectations.
* Comply with confidentiality laws and Marker Learning policies.


**To qualify for this position, you will need:**


* Exceptional written and verbal communication skills
* Professional bedside manner and ability to build rapport with clients in a remote environment
* Comfort with computers and willingness to learn our platforms. This position requires a working knowledge of computers and computer programs (e.g., the ability to conduct a Zoom meeting, etc.)
* Minimum of one year of psychoeducational evaluation testing with children and adults, including full test administration, scoring, and interpretation of standardized academic tests such as the WISC-V, WAIS-IV, WIAT-4, WJ, Conners-3, or KTEA-3.
* At least one year of experience in writing integrated psychological evaluation reports, including test interpretation, clinical formulation, and personalized recommendations.
* Master's degree (or higher) and a license to practice clinical or educational psychology in schools, per the state's requirements.
* Private location with secure WiFi to ensure confidentiality and uncompromised administration of the tests.

Across the healthcare landscape, psychologists are becoming integral before and after medical procedures to ensure the holistic care of patients, addressing both mental and physical health needs. Help Therapy seeks innovative psychologists in Washington with telehealth experience who are driven by the vision of treating the entire individual. By joining us, you can significantly reduce instances of preventable patient harm and enhance comprehensive care outcomes.

Our current focus is on psychologists who can perform Psychological Evaluation Clearances for Spinal Cord Stimulation (SCS) and Bariatric procedures through telehealth. Each pre-surgical evaluation offers a reimbursement rate ranging from $300 to $500.

**Not credentialed? No problem**! We will facilitate the credentialing process for you. If you are already Medicare credentialed, check out the additional benefits listed below.

**What is Help Therapy?**

Founded in 1993, Help Therapy has consistently worked towards broadening access to top-tier mental health services. We are the bridge that links everyone to therapy while streamlining the business aspects of therapy for professionals. At Help Therapy, we alleviate administrative tasks such as referrals, billing, marketing, credentialing, and compliance, allowing you to function akin to a private practice. We aim to transform your envisioned practice into reality.

**About Spinal Cord Stimulator Evaluations**

SCS represents a novel approach to managing chronic pain and is increasingly emerging as a preferred alternative to medications or back surgery. Yet, the procedure is not devoid of risks. The implanted SCS device connects directly to the patient's nervous system. Research underscores that psychological variables such as anxiety, depression, or inadequate coping mechanisms can adversely impact post-SCS care outcomes. This is where your expertise becomes invaluable in ensuring the patient's safety.

Patients contemplating SCS must first undergo psychological evaluations to ascertain the procedure's appropriateness for them. These evaluations amplify the chances of favorable care outcomes. Conducting a psychological evaluation for SCS entails a clinical interview and a mental status examination, all executed virtually and typically completed within an hour.

**How Help Therapy Works**

Become a part of our team in under a week and instantly start attending to patients for Psychological Evaluation Clearances. Our care team will manage your referrals for patients necessitating SCS pre-surgical psychological evaluations via telehealth. Billing for every psychological evaluation will be seamlessly handled by Help Therapy.

Unfamiliar with Psychological Assessments? Worry not. Our administrative support extends to resources and materials guiding you through the Psych Assessment process.

**Benefits**:

- Optimal flexibility - You decide your patient base and consultation timings.

**Requirements**:

- Individual NPI number

- Individual professional malpractice liability insurance policy

Perennial Wellness PLLC (PW) invites applications for a 24-month, full time (24+ patient hours/week) licensed psychologist or LCSW to work with patients exclusively via telehealth. LMSWs who are an excellent fit are encouraged to apply, as well.

*The candidate must either be licensed in NY or CT, or open to obtaining licensure in both states.*

**Practice Overview:**

PW is a thriving, full-fee group practice based in Westport, CT, serving patients via telehealth across New York and Connecticut. Website: www.perennialwellnessllc.com.

At PW, we are a collaborative team of psychologists and social workers, and we believe that women deserve a holistic, evidence-based approach to mental health care. We understand the unique experience of womanhood. From navigating early adulthood, to the perinatal and postpartum period, to motherhood, perimenopause and beyond, we integrate evidence-based approaches to mental health care with a deep understanding of interpersonal neurobiology, child development, and attachment philosophies.

Our team values close collaboration with one another, in the form of supervision, case consultation, didactic trainings, and team building experiences. We offer our patients:

1. Individual Therapy: Our approach combines a holistic approach to treatment with a feminist application of cognitive behavioral therapy. Treatment subspecialties include: Peripartum Mood and Anxiety Disorders (PMADs); Anxiety; OCD; Perfectionism; Relationship Concerns; Grief and Loss; Career Counseling; and Parenting a Child with Special Needs.

2. Parenting Support: Our work with parents is grounded in interpersonal neurobiology, respectful parenting principles and the DIR Floortime model.

3. Executive Functioning Skills Coaching: We integrate a nuanced awareness of a woman’s neurobiology with actionable, skill-building interventions to help each woman strengthen her productivity, organization, time management skills, and more.

All individual therapy patients are served via telehealth and while the position is fully remote, there are opportunities for in-person group work, workshops, etc. to be facilitated at the applicant’s discretion, if the applicant is local to Westport, CT.

At PW, teletherapy allows women who are seeking specialized, evidence-based treatment to receive high-quality, individualized care, regardless of their physical location. Teletherapy allows for accessibility and convenience when it’s hard for women to get into the office, which is often the case for women in the peripartum period.

**Clinician’s Responsibilities:**

* Conduct psychiatric intakes with diagnosis, treatment planning and coordination of care with outside providers.
* Conduct individual psychotherapy for a caseload of 24+ patients through an integrative, evidence-based approach.
* Conduct dyadic parent sessions as needed focused on providing supportive interventions to navigate complex parenting-related challenges and dynamics.
* Attend and participate in weekly individual supervision with Dr. Levine, as well as twice monthly group supervision with the full PW team.
* Opportunities to develop a smaller caseload focused on Executive Functioning Skills Coaching for women with ADHD, under additional specialized supervision from clinical neuropsychologist Dr. Danielle Auslander, PsyD.

The candidate will have input into the specific days/times that she holds “office hours,” as this is a benefit of telehealth as a treatment modality. The candidate must be willing to see patients during evening hours one day per week (4p – 8p).

This position is ideal for an applicant (1) with a strong interest in women’s mental health and (2) who is seeking to learn more about how to cultivate a thriving telehealth practice within a private practice setting. The candidate will receive training and support in all clinical aspects of her work, as well as in the business-related aspects of maintaining an ethical, legal, and successful telehealth private practice.

**PW is seeking to hire an applicant who is:** 

1. Passionate about women’s mental health.

2. Eager for mentorship and training in modern private practice development.

3. Motivated to develop competencies in building and sustaining an effective, legal and ethical telehealth practice.

4. Highly autonomous and organized.

5. Honest, collaborative, and eager to grow as a part of a team.

Emma Levine, PhD is the Director of PW. She is a psychologist and clinical supervisor. She was formerly the Assistant Director at Cognitive Therapy for Women in New York City, where she helped to develop and implement their Postdoctoral Fellowship supervision training program. She completed her APA-accredited pre-doctoral internship training at Andrus Children’s Center in Yonkers, NY.

Dr. Levine has served as an Adjunct Professor in the Graduate School of Education at Fordham University. She has advanced training in the assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of Perinatal Mood and Anxiety Disorders (PMADs) from the Selini Institute in New York City. She regularly presents to parents and school communities on topics related to maternal mental health and parenting.

**Compensation & Benefits:**

* Competitive W2, fee-for-service position.
* Opportunities to remain and grow as a part of the PW team available upon successful completion of contract.
* Weekly, individual supervision is provided.
* Twice monthly team case consultation and didactics.
* A 401K plan immediately upon hire.
* Stipends for trainings and conferences.
* This position does not include health or malpractice insurance.

PW is an equal opportunity employer, and we encourage candidates from diverse backgrounds to apply. We value hiring candidates who emulate diversity of life experiences, perspective and thought. We care deeply about cultivating a community among our team that feels safe and inclusive, and that encourages important dialogues about issues of diversity among our team and our patients.

**Applicant Instructions:**  Please send a cover letter indicating your interest in this position, a C.V., and two letters of recommendation to Dr. Emma Levine by email at drlevine@perennialwellnessllc.com. Interviews will be conducted on a rolling basis, and an offer will be made when the right applicant is found. No phone calls please.

Kids spend most of their days in the classroom. And teachers and staff, who play a vital role in their development, are often the first to notice when something is off. But with 1 in 5 young people struggling with mental health, schools are getting crushed by a downward spiral in student crises and staff burnout.



With large increases in federal funding for schools and the rise of telehealth, schools are reimagining what mental health support can look like.



Cartwheel is an early-stage startup building technology-enabled mental health services that put schools at the center. We see our role as supporting on-campus counselors, psychologists, and school social workers who see kids every day. Instead of going around them, we collaborate with them. This means:


* Earlier intervention
* Higher student and family engagement in care
* Better coordination among the trusted adults in a student's life


Kids shouldn't just aspire to get out of bed and drag themselves to class. They should be able to experience joy. They deserve to envision and build a life they're excited to live. If you join Cartwheel, you'll help make this vision a reality for millions of students across the country. We're backed by top investors including General Catalyst, BoxGroup, and Able Partners, and we're looking for scrappy, mission-driven teammates to join our team.

The above is a summary of the role, not an exhaustive list. If you think that you have most of the above but not everything, please apply. We'd love to hear from you.


**WHAT YOU'LL DO**



Clinical Care Process Improvement


* Conduct thorough analysis of current processes, identify pain points, bottlenecks, and areas for improvement.
* Facilitate workshops, brainstorming sessions, and process mapping exercises to find opportunities for process improvement.
* Collaborate across functions to smoothly implement process improvements.


Project Management


* Lead cross-functional project teams to implement process improvement initiatives.
* Collaborate with stakeholders to gather requirements, define project scope, objectives, and success criteria.
