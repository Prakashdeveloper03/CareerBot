We partner with primary care providers to improve the engagement and management of their Medicaid patients, providing independent practices access to specialized resources and clinical programs to address medical, social and behavioral patient needs. Our care ecosystem is equipped with enhanced technology and data interfaces to enable provider and patient success in a value-based environment. Guided by our core values of humility, continuous learning and feeling the weight, our team is on a mission to strengthen communities from within, unlocking people's ability to live their healthiest lives.

**We are looking for a Healthcare Data Scientist to join our team!** This is a highly visible role on our growing team, who will help pioneer and grow advanced analytic capabilities in healthcare as we work to improve care for the disadvantaged. This role reports directly to the Senior Vice President, Technology.


**Who We Are:**



We are a team of entrepreneurs passionate about improving health access and outcomes for those most in need. Diverge Health supports primary care practices to extend their reach and better serve patients on Medicaid. We bring providers significant infrastructure - contracts, local community health teams, provider liaisons, enabling technology and data – to improve outcomes for low-income patients, and enable success in value-based contracts.



Our technology organization is a small, growing team of problem solvers committed to improving healthcare outcomes for key disadvantaged populations. Our fully remote, entrepreneurial workforce strives to be…


* Innovative – We love creative problem solvers capable of outside the box solutioning, and who work hard to find simple solutions to hard problems.
* Independent – We take ownership of problems and have pride in our solutions, while working independently and supporting each other's efforts.
* Adaptive – As a small team, we all lean in across the breadth of our technologies and love to learn new technologies and dive into new areas - and to figure things out as we go.

  


**What We Do:**



We create and execute our technology enablement efforts – from software development to data/analytics, to infrastructure, and enterprise technologies. We work collaboratively across internal stakeholders to understand business problems and needs, and design & implement solutions that support our mission of providing effective and transformative patient-centered care.



Our data scientists team leverages integrations with all types of healthcare data - claims data, electronic health/medical records, healthcare information exchanges, continuity of care information, admit/discharge records, etc – to help identify patients that would benefit most from focused care efforts, and uses data to help shape the plans that offer care to this population. We leverage census and other population data to locate where such populations exist and are centered so that services can be effectively offered to large populations. We work to continually shape and improve healthcare so that it becomes both more effective and more cost-effective by analyzing clinical results and feeding that into future strategies.



We leverage a collection of cloud-based tools to store, analyze, and report within our data efforts. Our team members might leverage Snowflake to store vast SQL databases – defining data models thru dbt and integrations thru Hightouch or Dagster. Or they may leverage reporting capabilities of Sigma, Salesforce, or more to visualize results. They can leverage advanced databases of AWS such as Dynamo for NoSQL or Neptune for relational queries, and use the cloud for complex AI calculations with Jupyter notebooks in Sagemaker or other machine learning platforms.


**How You Can Help Us:**



Here are some key areas where we're looking to make our team stronger:


* Knowledge of healthcare ecosystems, information & analytics – we don't need a healthcare expert as we'll have others who can provide deep industry expertise, but general knowledge of the data sources, types, nomenclature, etc is important. This kind of knowledge often comes with 2-5 years of experience in healthcare but can be shown with other strong HCLS examples. We're expecting this role to quickly address such problems such as market analyses, risk stratification, & operational efficiency, and move on to problems in clinical efficacy and healthcare quality metrics. We'd love to hear what you've done in similar areas, and where you're looking to expand.
* Advanced SQL, analytics, and statistical background – someone who can understand the math and help navigate alternative statistical strategies. Having projects where you've investigated alternative data sources and approaches, and discussing how you helped guide teams to a successful decision and results, are a great way to demonstrate the ability to go deep.
* Adaptable willingness and ability to support the team and achieve results – someone who has shown themselves willing to jump into new areas, learn new technologies, and do so quickly in a way that impacts the business. Being able to discuss examples of having a measurable impact on the business and mastering new technologies would show how you are focused on making a difference for the team and the company.
* Keeping things simple – someone who remains focused on simple, reliable solutions even when the problems seem complex. We'd love to hear precedents where you took something really complicated and were able solve it with something simple, or in a way that addressed an even bigger problem in a general, flexible way.


And as potential bonus areas, we're also interested to hear about your


* More in-depth previous experience in healthcare or with healthcare informatics/analytics, demonstrating in-depth knowledge of healthcare industry and terminology
* Breadth of data skills across the board with knowledge of infrastructures (in Snowflake, AWS), data modeling, reporting & visualizations, statistics/analytics, AI/ML, Jupyter notesbooks, etc – we're still a small team and being able to demonstrate breadth of knowledge is as important as demonstrating depth.
* A demonstrated ability to impact care quality and quality gaps – showing you can help quantify care quality or measure HEDIS/STARS metrics is a great benefit
* History of automating data, analytics, and AI/ML pipelines to improve developer reliability, speed, and quality.

 **Our Investors**

Rockerbox fuels the growth of leading Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) brands such as Tula, Figs, and Burton. Our guiding principle is that no marketing organization should require a data engineering team to make data-driven decisions. We take on the technical challenges of collecting and consolidating all marketing data into a single platform to enable any marketing organization, big or small, to focus on their core strength: building their brand.



The Data Science team at Rockerbox is responsible for designing, deploying, and maintaining ML-backed features including our Media Mix modeling (MMM) product, the cornerstone of our measurement diversification efforts. Reporting to the Head of Data, you will collaborate with teammates across Engineering, Product, and Customer Success to build impactful new features and iterate on existing ones to meet the evolving needs of our current and new customers. We are looking for data scientists who thrive in a collaborative, dynamic environment and will make a direct impact on the next version of our product as we scale to thousands of customers.


**Responsibilities:**


* Run the existing MMM model for current and future customers, adapting the model to specific use-case requirements as required.
* Play a critical role in advancing the MMM model's capabilities by developing new and improved features
* Develop advanced statistical models and machine learning algorithms

* Exceptional problem-solving, critical thinking, and communication abilities


**About Rockerbox:**



Rockerbox started out as a marketing channel to help brands to attract new customers. However, we found that we were frequently given less credit due to misattributions that resulted from the fragmentation of marketing data across multiple platforms. So we pivoted the company to solve this problem. We created a platform where brands can integrate all of their data-addressing the data fragmentation problem-so they can understand the contribution of each marketing channel in bringing them new customers.



Rockerbox is in a continual state of evolution. We are not impeded by past decisions and strongly believe that what has gotten us to where we are may not be what gets us to where we want to be. We value transparency and encourage all Rockerboxers to speak their minds and take actions that will make the company or the product a better version of itself.

* Remote-first - work anywhere in the US
* Health, vision, and dental insurance

We believe that life is better when you’re with your friends, and our mission is to fill everyone’s life with rich and meaningful friendships. We do this by creating the easiest way to hear your friends’ voices throughout the day, to meet their friends, and to talk about anything. As the world goes increasingly remote, we think being with friends is more important than ever.  

We take pride in being a small and productive team, with a relentless focus on building a product that people love. As a company we are well funded, with backing from a16z and dozens of the best angel investors in the world, providing us with years of runway. We love what we do and have a lot of work ahead of us. If this sounds interesting to you, we’d love to talk.  

The Role
As a Product Data Scientist, you will work closely with our product and engineering teams to formulate and answer key questions about our product. You will play a central role in collecting, modeling, and analyzing data, and will drive meaningful changes to our product and user experiences based on your findings. In this role, you will report to our Head of Growth. We are a remote-first company, but have a headquarters office in San Francisco.  

In this role, you will play a key part in defining the data culture within Clubhouse and ensure that we have principled, data-driven decision-making processes. As part of the early data team, you will work on numerous zero-to-one projects and will have a direct impact on our product direction. You’ll have the opportunity to work alongside our product and engineering teams on high-profile feature launches that are used by millions of people.### **Who you are**

+ **You are curious, inquisitive, and enjoy solving ambiguous, open-ended problems.** You are able to identify high impact problem areas with little direction. You have a healthy skepticism about data and know when to dig deeper into a problem.
+ **You bring deep experience in product analytics and experiment design.** You likely bring 4+ years of experience as a product data scientist or product analyst and have deep experience working on consumer products. You are comfortable with advanced modeling and statistical techniques and are highly fluent in SQL and Python. You have deep experience with experiment design and analysis.

+ **You bias towards action.** You like to build and ship - favoring practical choices, speed and a respect for sequencing. You focus on the things that matter and push back on things that don’t. You make deadlines for yourself and you move fast.
+ **You’re scrappy and entrepreneurial.** You thrive in fast-paced environments and are comfortable with not knowing the answer to something. You are willing to roll up your sleeves no matter what the challenge is.
+ **You take pride in what you do.** You care deeply about your work. You read through details and think about every bit of the user experience. If something seems off, you come up with a good solution and fix it without being asked to do so. You’re proactive with suggestions and people know they can count on you to get things done.
  


### **What you will do**

+ **You’ll help the team untangle key product questions with the team.** There are numerous complex product questions that we would look to a data partner to help the team untangle. On a given day, you may be performing and sharing complex analyses that inform a wide variety of decisions. Or you may be playing a hands-on role in product launches, ensuring that we understand the impact of new features on users and can identify potential issues early in the process. You will have the opportunity to do foundational analysis on important, unsolved questions across a wide range of problem spaces.
+ **You’ll grow and improve rapidly.** At Clubhouse you’ll be working with an incredible team, who love to learn from and teach each other. You’ll find yourself stretching to new areas, immersed in feedback, challenged by your teammates, and growing your skills on a daily basis.
+ **You’ll shape the product strategy.** You will get to use your own product (and talk with others while they are using it) every day, and have significant input into its development. Your ideas will always be heard.
+ **You’ll be an owner.** We believe in hiring people and giving them as much responsibility as they can handle. Whether it’s leading our work on a new platform or single-handedly figuring out how to scale concurrent audio streams to reach millions of users, we’ll make sure you are always pushing yourself to new levels.
+ **You’ll create something meaningful.** Social products allow people to connect in ways that were never before possible. When the telephone was invented, it suddenly allowed people to speak with others across the world. Thanks to FaceTime, grandparents everywhere can now watch their grandchildren grow up. At Clubhouse, you’ll be figuring out something entirely new for the world—a positive product that brings people’s voices together for deep and meaningful conversations, creates new relationships, builds empathy across
