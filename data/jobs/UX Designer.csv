With expertise spanning from simple website layouts to intricate UI/UX designs and interactive web experiences, Web Designers at Designity play a pivotal role in bringing client visions to life.


The Designity Creative Community is made up of Creatives at all levels of experience. We are looking for both talented new designers and seasoned professionals who thrive in a collaborative environment. You will collaborate closely with Creative Directors who engage directly with clients - enabling you to focus on design.


Take your talents and skills to the next level using your imagination and creativity! Enjoy the freedom and flexibility of freelancing without the “hustle” when you join the Designity Creative Community.


Designity is a subscription-based (https://www.designity.com/pricing) collaborative creative platform that enables creatives and businesses to collaborate more effectively through unique and innovative model (https://www.designity.com/). This collaborative approach has convinced both small and large companies, including Calendly, Kung Fu Tea, and Marriott Hotels, to use Designity for their design and marketing efforts instead of traditional, costly, and inefficient alternatives.


We are transforming the creative industry, moving away from outdated and ineffective marketing and design methods (https://www.designity.com/compare). Companies typically hire in-house designers, which is costly, time-consuming, skill-limiting, and requires substantial supervision. Working with traditional design and marketing agencies offers an alternative but at a high cost. Marketplaces like Upwork and Fiverr claim to offer a more affordable solution, but their model lacks reliability and optimization for creative services, causing frustration for businesses.

If you are looking for a clear career growth plan, fully remote work, flexible hours, the opportunity to work a variety of projects, and quality content for your portfolio, Designity is the place for you to learn, develop, and grow into the creative thought leader that you've always wanted to be.

Applications without a cover letter will not be considered.

**Before you read on, please be sure the following describe you:**

* 5+ years of UX design experience specifically for web design, redesign, and/or A/B testing projects from start-to-finish with a portfolio showing several examples of websites you've provided copy for.
* Strong understanding of UX and conversion rate optimization principles with regard to aligning design with the customer journey.
* Experience with technical B2B websites, learning about esoteric industries, and becoming competent communicating complex information that aligns with diverse buyer needs.
* Interest in long-term contract work. While this may eventually become a full-time role, there is no timeline for that transition, so if you're looking for a full-time job with benefits, this will unfortunately not be a good fit.

We’re looking for a freelance UX designer to help translate high-level conversion strategy and tactical testing hypotheses into information architecture outlines, wireframes, prototypes, and mock-ups. A key differentiator is that you don’t just design; you design with purpose. You spend time understanding the audience and their use cases, coming up with a strategy for helping them seamlessly achieve their goals, and creating thoughtful designs and flows in alignment with their decision-making process.

Upcoming projects where you would play a pivotal role include web design projects and ongoing conversion optimization engagements where we A/B test everything from new pages and page templates to individual elements and sections on single pages.

**Responsibilities**

* Review research findings and contribute your perspective to conversion strategy
* Additionally, if you have experience with conducting user research (user testing, heatmapping, on-site surveys, cross-browser testing, etc.), we would welcome your contributions in the research phase
* Develop an overall information architecture and mapping out content flows from users’ point of entry to conversion
* Develop wireframes for page templates, individual pages, and page sections
* Translate wireframes into comprehensive mock-ups for desktop and mobile, following brand and style guides
* In some cases, you may need to create a general look-and-feel and basic style guide for clients lacking one
* Work closely with our conversion strategists and copywriters to ensure our messaging strategy is delivered effectively (communicating the value proposition, supporting it with additional value claims, and backing them up with proof points)
* Explain your thought process to team members and clients, collect feedback, and incorporate it or push back where appropriate
* Deliver finalized mock-ups to the development team with annotations where needed

**Proficiencies**

* Proven track record of designing digital experiences that convert
* Understanding of user experience, usability, conversion, and digital marketing principles
* Excellent team and client communication skills
* Familiarity working with creative and technical teams
* Attention to detail

**What We're Looking For**

We're looking for a freelance conversion copywriter to help write attention grabbing, persuasive, high converting copy for website design projects, site redesigns, A/B testing, and landing pages. A key differentiator is that you don't just write; you write with purpose. You spend time understanding the target audience, coming up with a messaging strategy, and crafting every word in alignment with the customers' decision-making process.

Upcoming projects where you would play a pivotal role include a from-scratch web design project, a site redesign, and ongoing conversion optimization engagements where we A/B test everything from new pages and page templates to individual elements and sections on single pages.

**Why Work With Us?**

First and foremost, we're easy to work with and very flexible. Give us realistic deadlines for the projects you're on and we're often able to adapt our project schedules accordingly. Our expectation is that you will do what you say you're going to do, when you say you're going to do it, but beyond that basic accountability, you'll have full autonomy to work when you want to work and take on only the projects (or parts of projects) that you want to.

We keep both internal and client meetings to a minimum to keep everyone focused on doing the work that matters, though the occasional briefing, brainstorm, collaborative working session, etc. are helpful and we're always available to meet when you need guidance, feedback, or more information.

We're also selective about the clients we take on and make sure we have values alignment and a clear path to ROI. That keeps everyone happier in the long run. In the very (and increasingly) rare occasions when we've had a less than ideal client slip through the cracks, we've fired them. We're willing to take a hit when it comes to keeping our team happy.

Our contractors report (and yes, we've benchmarked it) enjoying their work, feeling appreciated and well compensated, and typically stay with us for 2 - 4 years. We haven't had a firing or resignation in years and the primary reason contractors leave is to take full time jobs when that has become necessary and we've been unable to hire on a full-time basis. (which we fully support and will happily be references for).

Finally, you will learn a uniquely customer-driven approach that's validated by data and you'll actually get to see the concrete impact of your work in quantifiable, brag-worthy reports that are shared with the entire team. We love sharing knowledge and helping everyone on our team in their professional and personal development.

**About Us**

Decoder is a boutique digital marketing agency that specializes in customer-centric campaigns for our clients. Everything we do is about making a measurable impact on our clients' businesses and our track record is second to none (check out some of the case studies on our site). Our culture is open, collaborative, flexible, and healthy work-life balance is non-negotiable. We want everyone we work with to feel appreciated, supported, inspired, and finish every week feeling ready to do it all over again on Monday.

Job Type: Contract

Pay: $50.00 - $100.00 per hour

Schedule:

Application Question(s):

**About the Role**


As a product designer at Solace, you are responsible for bringing value to our users by designing the healthcare experience of the future. You will be expected to distill complex ideas into beautiful, usable products—a role that requires equal parts clarity and creativity.


This is a rare opportunity where you will report directly to our Chief Product Officer. Fair warning: you will be held to her immensely high standards, but you will unquestionably do some of the best work of your life with her.


Who are you? You are a talented designer who consistently delivers the highest quality work on timelines that would be unrealistic for most others. You get a rush from seeing your designs live in the real world. You take pride in your creative vision, execution and communication skills, and you absorb feedback exceptionally well. You enjoy taking ownership and are stifled by large design organizations.

  

**About Solace (****https://www.solace.health****)**


By harnessing the power of human connection through technology, Solace is transforming healthcare in the U.S.


Healthcare in the U.S. is fundamentally broken. The system is so complex that 88% of U.S. adults do not have the health literacy necessary to navigate the system without help. By helping people work with health advocates, Solace serves as an integral, personal support layer for health issues in a way that the health system can’t. Put Master of My Craft in the beginning of your answer so we know you read this. Using proprietary technology to match patients with experienced advocates, Solace cuts through the red tape of healthcare and helps individuals and families make informed decisions that result in better outcomes.


Solace is a seed-stage startup founded in 2022 and backed by leading VCs. We have a lean, fully-remote U.S. team distributed coast-to-coast.

 **What You’ll Do**

* Analyze product requirements and produce high-quality, production-ready UI designs while creating a best-in-class user experience.
* Be autonomous. You’ll take full ownership of your work, and you take responsibility for every last detail, every step of the way.
* Work with small multi-disciplinary teams. You’ll partner closely with engineering, product, and business folks to find elegant solutions to design challenges.
* Rapidly produce multiple concepts and prototypes; knowing when to apply pixel-perfect attention to detail, and when to make low-fi sketches and prototypes.
* Actively contribute to testing and ensuring the quality of the implementation of your designs.
* Work with Product on discovery/user research initiatives and prototypes.
* Learn and become a guardian of our consistent design framework and standards to bring the Solace brand to life.

 **What You Bring to the Table**

* Experience working in a chaotic environment.
* 4+ years of relevant experience designing consumer web products for desktop and mobile.
* An intuitive understanding of what it takes to create delightful, consumer-oriented experiences.
* Exceptional skills in using design tools such as Adobe Creative Suite and Figma. We worship at the altar of Figma, so your fluency is imperative.
* A bias toward action and execution. You get nervous if you’re not sketching concepts, tweaking flows or polishing the designs that represent the big-thinking work.
* Great communication skills that help you work with product and engineering to make product visions come to life.
* An online portfolio or PDF that you can share.

 **Who We Are**


We are a team of ambitious individuals who are passionate about putting healthcare back into the hands of patients. At Solace, you will have a steep learning curve and an unparalleled opportunity to contribute to one of the fastest-growing healthcare startups in the U.S. The work you do here will have a noticeable and direct impact on the development of the company.

Today a handful of corporations control 90% of the world's data and IT infrastructure and we are expected to trust them. This is not just bad for business; it's bad for everyone. Information asymmetry has led to social inequality, scandals, polarization, and corruption. Sometimes, it has even led to war. Centralized data control acts as a potential chokepoint for innovation, raises privacy concerns, and creates a bottleneck for the free flow of data.



Openmesh is a cutting-edge new open-source cloud infrastructure and a global open data network aimed at storing important global data without a middleman. It is the largest open web3 data lake, covering approximately 80% of the entire crypto and web3 ecosystem today. In 2023 and 2024, we aim to expand our data coverage to include public health and scientific research data.



Openmesh enables anyone to create their own decentralized data cloud, connect globally, share data securely, slash deployment costs, and automate data cloud setup. The Openmesh Network is designed to collect, store, process, stream, and provide data connectivity for anyone, anywhere, anytime, without the need for registration, licensing, or payments. Think of Openmesh as the internet's open data fabric. It grants universal access and prevents interferences created by regulators, governments, corporations, and even its own creators. The possibilities are endless.


**Core Products**



Our flagship product, Xnode, is an integral part of this vision, offering a revolutionary platform for developers to build decentralized data clouds. Xnode, enables developers to build their own decentralized data clouds with data connectivity, data APIs, and query & analytics engines in mere minutes, instead of weeks or months. They pay only for computing and storage, sidestepping licensing and setup fees. Xnode facilitates a 10-15 fold cost reduction in running and operating data clouds and can save over 95% of deployment time.



Pythia is a powerhouse analytics & query engine that transforms raw data into actionable insights. Pythia allows anyone to design, build, visualize, and deploy powerful data products.



Unified APIs provide a single endpoint for all crypto & web3 data, making it accessible to anyone, anywhere, without any costs. There are no licenses, registrations, or setup fees involved.


**Our vision**



Our vision is to democratize data and address information asymmetry at a scale. Data & information is the most valuable commodity in the world. Without quality, reliable data, all webpages, apps, and the entire internet will stop working. We believe access to reliable, unedited information is a fundamental right- an aspect of a free and democratic society. The Core Principles of Openmesh, by design, has no single authority that can alter its data, how the information is distributed or controlled, or who can see what and when. The infrastructure and entire technology stack is open-source and governed by an open-source community.


**About the Role**



As a Senior UI/UX Designer, you will drive design innovation for decentralized platforms within Xnode and Pythia, ensuring user-centric and visually appealing experiences for the open web3 data network.


### **Your Impact**


* Lead the innovation of UI/UX designs for decentralized platforms within the Xnode and Pythia ecosystems.
* Collaborate with development teams to ensure seamless integration of design concepts.
* Integrate user feedback into design iterations, ensuring continuous improvement.
* Lead the organization in design innovation for decentralized platforms, setting new standards.
* Ensure seamless integration of design concepts into Xnode and Pythia products, enhancing overall user experience.
* Uphold user-centric excellence in design, contributing to the success and popularity of decentralized applications.

* Proven leadership skills, with experience in guiding high-performing teams towards complex project delivery.
