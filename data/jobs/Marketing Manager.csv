Designity is a subscription-based (https://www.designity.com/pricing) collaborative creative platform that enables creatives and businesses to collaborate more effectively through unique and innovative model (https://www.designity.com/).

**OUR STATEMENT OF FAITH**

**The Foundation of What We Believe**


As a Christian organization, Prison Fellowship believes in the full authority of the Bible as God’s inspired word and the complete tenets of the Apostles’ Creed and the Nicene Creeds.


We believe in one God, Creator and Lord of the Universe, the co-eternal Trinity; Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. We believe that Jesus Christ, God’s Son, was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, lived a sinless life, died a substitutionary atoning death on the cross, rose bodily from the dead and ascended to heaven where, as truly God and truly man, He is the only mediator between God and man. We believe that the Bible is God’s authoritative and inspired Word, without error in all its teachings.

**How We Are Compelled to Live and to Act**


We believe that Christians, both individually and corporately, must submit to the Bible, as God’s authoritative, divine and inspired Word, in all matters of belief and conduct.

**How Our Mission and Our Approach is Shaped**


Prison Fellowship exists to bring glory to God and share His truth and love with those we serve, our employees, volunteers, and communities, according to scriptural truths.


Our Mission is to help restore those affected by crime and incarceration. This Mission is founded on the biblical conviction that all people are created in God's image and that no life is beyond God's reach.


Therefore, we believe that a restorative approach to prisoners, former prisoners, and all those affected by crime and incarceration reflects the God-given dignity and potential of every person and can help individual lives and communities flourish.

**What the Hope of Jesus Means for Others**


We believe that Jesus—Himself brought to trial, executed, buried, and brought to life again—offers hope, healing, and a new purpose for each life. He can make even the most broken people and situations affected by crime and incarceration whole again.

**What this Means for Communities**


Through an amazing awakening to new hope and life purpose available through Jesus, those who once broke the law are transformed and mobilized to serve their neighbors, replacing the cycle of crime with a cycle of renewal that restores entire communities. Because the Bible calls us to remember and visit those in prison, we believe that every Christian is compelled to contribute to this restorative cycle.

Hi, we're Banzai

Today, marketers have access to more resources and tools than ever before, so why is most marketing so cringe-worthy? Marketing has lost touch with the humans behind the clicks, opens, and form submits, but Banzai wants to change that. That's why our mission is to make marketing more human.

At Banzai, we think the secret to better marketing is educating, learning from, and building relationships with buyers. This new approach is called Engagement Marketing.

Banzai is leading the Engagement Marketing movement. Our products reach millions of users every year and help our customers drive more revenue through better events, webinars, content, and data. Best of all, Banzai makes marketing a little more human for all of us.

Join Banzai to help build a future that puts people at the center of marketing.

**Summary:**

Banzai is looking for a Customer Success Manager to join our Customer Experience team! As a Customer Success Manager, your main duty will be to focus on the success and growth of our existing customers by building relationships, monitoring usage and adoption, and providing training and consulting. Your ultimate goal will be to encourage expansion and renewals.

We’re looking for a self-motivated and customer-centric individual that has experience and energy around customer satisfaction *and* growing revenue.

**Expectations of Role:**

The primary focus of this role is to impact NRR (Net Retention Rate). Each quarter you will have objectives with revenue targets for renewals and expansions within your assigned customer segment. With that end goal in mind, you will work backwards in determining your actionable key results to help you hit that target. You will also work closely with Customer Marketing to determine campaigns and webinars to help drive customer success.

**What an average day/week looks like:**

* Proactive Customer Communication: you will never run out of reasons and opportunities to proactively reach out to your customers!
* Reactive Customer Communication: timely responses to customer emails are key, so you won’t end your work day without replying to all customer emails that came in throughout the day.
* Customer Meetings: your day will most likely have a variety of new customer onboardings and existing customer check-ins.
* Objectives: staying on top of your objectives and making sure you’re on pace is essential. As a CSM your main objectives will be for renewal and expansion revenue, so you’ll want to make sure you are both keeping your eye on upcoming renewals and looking for expansion opportunities.
* Internal Communication and Meetings: our main internal communication tool is Slack. This is where you’ll be able to get (and give) quick answers to questions, read updates, and build community! You’ll definitely have weekly 1:1s with your manager and a weekly all staff meeting we call “Weekly Wins”, along with other one off meetings here and there.

**Desired Qualifications, Skills, & Experience**

* 2+ years of experience in a Customer Success or Account Management role, preferably in SaaS
* A strong track record of hitting renewal and expansion targets, ultimately improving NRR
* Experience managing accounts across multiple market segments and building strong partnerships with varied levels of stakeholders
* Webinar experience strongly preferred; marketing experience a bonus
* Detailed Salesforce hygiene; keep account notes updated
* Motivated self-starter with a growth mindset
* Passionate about providing excellent customer experiences
* Ability to learn multiple products quickly
* Proactive, with exceptional follow through
* Excellent written and verbal communication skills
* People oriented; quickly builds positive rapport
* Embodiment of our company values (Learning, Serving Others, and 10,000 Years), both internally and externally.

**Benefits**

* 401(k) plan (US based)
* Health, Dental, Vision, Life, and Long-Term Disability insurance (US based)
* Unlimited PTO policy (salaried) or hourly PTO policy
* Remote first company
* 12 weeks fully paid parental leave
* Working with a truly mission-driven team motivated by excellence
* Real room for growth in professional and personal development
* 2 paid mental health days every quarter, plus one full week of paid mental health rest every year
* Clear objectives, direction and empowerment from executive leadership

Job Type: Full-time

Pay: $80,000.00 - $120,000.00 per year

Benefits:

* 401(k)
* Health insurance
* Paid time off
* Parental leave

Nearly every company in the world runs on custom software: Gartner estimates that up to 50% of all code is written for internal use. This is the operational software for refunding orders, underwriting loans, onboarding employees, analyzing transactions, and providing customer support. But most companies don't have adequate resources to properly invest in these tools, leading to a lot of old and clunky internal software or, even worse, users still stuck in manual and spreadsheet flows.



At Retool, we're on a mission to bring good software to everyone. We're building a new type of development platform that combines the benefits of traditional software development with a drag-and-drop UI editor and AI, making it dramatically faster to build internal tools. We believe that the future of software development lies in abstracting away the tedious and repetitive tasks developers waste time on, while creating reusable components that act as a force multiplier for future developers and projects. The result is not just productivity, but good software by default. And that's a mission worth striving for.



Today, our customers span from small startups building their first operational tools to Fortune 500 companies building mission-critical apps for thousands of users across their business. Interested in joining us? Let us know!

**WHY WE'RE LOOKING FOR YOU:**



Retool's GTM teams are growing in size and complexity in order to support extremely ambitious growth in the coming years.

You'll support strategies from PLG to paid media to ABM. You will be responsible for improving our visibility into the performance of our marketing funnel(s) and ensuring the health and integrity of marketing metrics on an ongoing basis. You'll be a key contributor to our planning process, providing analysis and reporting to our marketing, finance, and exec team to help us understand the ROI of our marketing spend and opportunities for growth.


**IN THIS ROLE, YOU'LL:**


* Own the planning process for the marketing team
* Use quantitative and qualitative insights to inform growth strategy, roadmap, and prioritization for the Marketing team
* Work with the data and web engineering team to properly instrument and measure our funnels

* Own regular reporting on the overall health of marketing initiatives and top-of-funnel performance across marketing
* Partner with finance to provide visibility into ROI on marketing spend


**THE SKILLSET YOU'LL BRING:**


* 8+ years of marketing experience, with 4-6 years of direct experience working in marketing operations for a B2B SaaS business, preferably with both a product-led and saled-led sales motion, and 6-8 years of total experience including related teams
