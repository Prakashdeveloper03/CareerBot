We believe great skin shouldn’t be a luxury, but a fact of life.  

  

Most brand management roles at traditional brands are slow and stagnant. You inherit a great history, but end up focused on protecting past success rather than blazing paths for future growth.

At Curology, we’re changing that. We are looking to hire an Associate Brand Manager to help propel Agency to our next level of growth. Your job will be to support the Brand Lead of Agency to launch 360 marketing campaigns, bring Agency’s brand marketing to the next level and supercharge our evergreen marketing across organic social, influencer, PR and more.

+ Lead our brand’s expansion into new distribution channels, developing competitive pricing strategies, best in class content to support the launch and managing marketing budget

### **About you:**

+ **You are analytical but able to go beyond the data:** you are able to derive key insights from a variety of data points and sources and put them into context to get to the “so what”
+ **You love a challenge and are self-driven:** you thrive under pressure and can very quickly become a subject matter expert on any subject through self-drive; you can take on projects and manage them end-to-end, seeking help and guidance as needed
+ **Exceptional communicator:** you can clearly communicate complex ideas through different mediums; you are able to build relationships quickly
+ **Humble and a great team player:** you are constantly trying to learn from others and you have a flexible approach that enables strong collaboration with cross-functional partners; you have a can-do attitude and will roll up your sleeves to do what is needed for the team
+ **2-4 Years in CPG Brand Management:** You have worked in Brand Management at a traditional CPG company, with experience in DTC
+ **Motivated by curiosity,** whether solving a problem, pursuing a new experience, or seeking creative inspiration
+ **Results-driven, solution-oriented, flexible,** self-driving, and must have the ability to change course quickly

We are a leading Australian SEO agency looking for a talented SEO Specialist to join our team on a full-time basis. The successful candidate will be responsible for managing clients' websites, and improving organic rankings through SEO. The emphasis of this role is knowing WHAT to do, not just HOW to do it. Which means you will need to have an understanding of what outcomes will achieve maximum ROI for clients. You will not have many clients, but the expectation is that work is done exceptionally well as there will be ample time to make SEO decisions. You will start with about 5 clients, but will never have more than 10. This is not a client facing role, which means that you will never directly communicate with clients. However, this means that you must be on top of the campaigns at all times and proactively make SEO magic happen. Reporting will be done to the director once per week, and a log should be maintained for all SEO actions (so you must be organised). You MUST have at least 2 years of experience in a similar role.
