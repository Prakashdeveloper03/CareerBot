In the world of Agile, our analysts are champions of quality. From crafting and executing plans to identifying bugs and glitches- they work hand in hand with our development staff collaborating to deliver flawless products. Diving deep into exploratory testing by concocting scenarios and trying to break the software in the most unexpected ways, they uncover hidden defects that even the developers didn't anticipate.

We encourage owning your work life balance with a rich PTO allotment that includes accrued time, floating holidays, company holidays and time off for volunteering/community work. We don’t just provide it; we encourage you to take it.

  

At NorthWinds, we know that that not all Quality Assurance Analysts are the same. Experience matters- we recognize and reward that. This isn’t your average QA gig. Our Quality Assurance Analysts don’t stop at testing and release- their expertise is vital in cultivating a culture of quality throughout our company.



We are seeking a seasoned Quality Assurance Analyst that has strong manual testing experience to work on our mid office team which is responsible for the customer service functionality that is native to Keyspring, our key Product. Work products built, maintained, and extended by this team include Member Portal, Provider Portal, Employer Portal, Broker Portal, Individual Storefront, and Service 360.
