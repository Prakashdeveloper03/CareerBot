Full Time



Canada, UK, USA, Remote

 **About the Cycles team**



The Cycles team (previously known as CoFi, see thread) at Informal Systems is part of an early stage startup effort within the company to build an open clearing protocol, a platform to clear the most debt for the most people with the least money. In contrast to existing payment systems focused solely on the transfer of assets, Cycles is focused instead on the clearing of debts by operating over the network of liabilities which underly all payments. By taking this network view, Cycles unlocks profound new opportunities for regular businesses to access preferred sources of liquidity, and to reduce risk both individually and systemically.  

  

Cycles enables businesses to easily and privately upload their obligations, connect their sources of liquidity, settle up, and save. Turns out there are significant inefficiencies in the payments graph that create cash flow stress and higher working capital costs for businesses. These inefficiencies derive from lack of a coherent view of the obligation network, and can be resolved through atomic multi-lateral fault-tolerant execution of solutions to a flow optimization problem defined over the network of payment obligations and available sources of liquidity. Using the network of obligations as a foundation, Cycles provides a platform for new kinds of currencies, lending protocols, and issuance protocols to be integrated in a risk-reduced environment for the benefit of real-world commerce.

  

We're hiring a Senior Rust developer to join our early stage team in building the algorithms and protocols that will bring this unique payment system design to life, and directly improve the sustainability of SMEs around the world.

 **About the Role**



As a Rust Developer on the Cycles team, you will play a crucial role in shaping the core algorithm and protocols of our platform. You'll design and implement graph flow solver algorithms, privacy preserving protocols (TEEs and ZKPs), settlement protocols, and credit systems, and integrate them with on-chain environments like Cosmos and Ethereum. The Cycles team at Informal Systems has deep expertise in blockchain protocols, graph theory, payment protocols, and software engineering.

 **What sets us apart**



Informal Systems has a strong, collaborative, remote-first culture that prioritizes autonomy, mastery, ownership, and purpose. Beyond the Cycles team, we have deep theoretical and practical distributed systems and formal methods experience. Our other business units perform security audits, run network infrastructure, and lead development of interchain protocols.

  

**What your primary responsibilities will be:**


* Be a driven, effective, and collaborative member of the team
* Design, implement, test, maintain, and evolve production blockchain protocols, including:
	+ Core graph algorithm in Rust: performance, scalability, cost functions, non-determinism, distributional effects, proof generation, etc.
	+ Privacy preserving protocols: Secure protocols for trust minimized execution of solvers in TEEs, on-chain remote attestation and zk proof verification of graph solutions, integration with Multi-Asset-Shielded Pools, etc.
	+ Credit protocols: Integrations with external DeFi credit protocols, secure graph queries, native credit protocols, mutual credit, p2p loans, reputational collateral, etc.
* Expand expertise and track ongoing developments in finance, accounting, and payments in order to deliver the most performant and reliable open clearing club for the world

  

  

**What we look for in a successful Rust developer:**


* 5+ years production software engineering experience
* 2+ years experience with Rust development
* Strong background in graph theory and network flow algorithms
* Familiarity with blockchain protocols, TEEs, ZK proofs and their software ecosystems
* Ability to work effectively in a diverse, remote-first, and international team environment
* Proven ability to contribute innovative ideas and solutions.

  

  

**Some of our benefits include:**


* A unique, caring and friendly culture (learn more about how we work here)
* 25 days (5 weeks) of paid vacation annually, plus 3 Spiritual Days
* Company closure from December 25th to January 1

* Annual company retreats

**About our Client**
--------------------

Our client is writing the next chapter in the history of software development.

Today a handful of corporations control 90% of the world's data and IT infrastructure and we are expected to trust them. This is not just bad for business; it's bad for everyone. Information asymmetry has led to social inequality, scandals, polarization, and corruption. Sometimes, it has even led to war. Centralized data control acts as a potential chokepoint for innovation, raises privacy concerns, and creates a bottleneck for the free flow of data.

About the Graph:


The Graph (https://thegraph.com/) is the indexing and query layer of web3. The Graph Network's self service experience for developers launched in July 2021. Developers build and publish open APIs, called subgraphs, that applications can query using GraphQL. The Graph supports indexing data from multiple different networks including Ethereum, NEAR, Arbitrium, Optimism, Polygon, Avalanche, Celo, Fantom, Moonbeam, IPFS, and PoA with more networks coming soon. To date, tens-of-thousands of subgraphs have been deployed on the hosted service, and now subgraphs can be deployed directly on the network. Over 28,000 developers have built subgraphs for applications such as Uniswap, Synthetix, KnownOrigin, Art Blocks, Balancer, Livepeer, DAOstack, Audius, Decentraland, and many others.


If you are a developer building an application or web3 application, you can use subgraphs for indexing and querying data from blockchains. The Graph (https://thegraph.com/) allows applications to efficiently and performantly present data in a UI and allows other developers to use your subgraph too! You can deploy a subgraph (https://thegraph.com/docs/quick-start) to the network using the newly launched Subgraph Studio (https://thegraph.com/studio/) or query existing subgraphs that are in the Graph Explorer (https://thegraph.com/explorer/).

**About Horizon Blockchain Games:**  

At Horizon, we’re building a New Dimension where Internet economies are fun, accessible, and for the benefit of all participants.
  
  

**We have two amazing products to make this real:**  

Skyweaver, a digital trading card game—powered by blockchain—where players actually own the game items they win and purchase. For the first time, gamers can easily and securely sell and trade their items.
  
  

And Sequence, our Web3 wallet and platform, provides a seamless user and developer experience for Ethereum, NFTs, Web3, DeFi and Dapps, allowing any web application to integrate with blockchain in two minutes. Sequence makes it easy for users, developers and companies to access and build the next generation of Internet economies and experiences.
  
  

Skyweaver has the chance to become a groundbreaking TCG with its unprecedented player-owned economy, novel gameplay, and an already fervent community during its Private Beta. And, Sequence is poised to drive Web3 adoption on a massive scale by making blockchain easy, fun and powerful for users and developers.
  
  

While the challenge is hard, we find it incredibly fun. And we have the outstanding ingredients to make it happen: a well-capitalized company with some of the best investors in the world (Reddit co-founder, Coinbase), an amazing team of leaders in the blockchain space, engineers who have built widely popular open source, a former top McKinsey strategy consultant, and founders who have built and sold successful companies. You'll get to work with and learn from them all.
  
  

If you connect with our mission, want to collaborate with wonderful teammates in a caring culture, and are looking for the chance to deliver massive impact at a fast moving startup committed to redefining the Internet as we know it, we’d love to hear from you! You can learn more at https://horizon.io (https://horizon.io/)
  
  

**About the role:**  

As a Senior Producer at Horizon, you will have the unique opportunity to own the development and launch of Skyweaver from Day 1. You will work to deliver a commercially successful trading card game that already has 47,000 created accounts, and a waitlist of 180,000 players.
  
  

Most excitingly, you’ll be part of defining something innovative, as we create a new market category of blockchain games--something no one has done.
  
  

This role is important, and you have the opportunity to make a massive impact at the company. Unlike larger studios, our team is small, and your decisions will carry weight. You will work closely with senior leaders, and work 1-1 with our Game Designer, Head of Design, Director of Product, CFO, and CEO, on a daily basis. You’ll have direct visibility into the company and its strategy, and we expect you to be intimately involved in those discussions.
  
  

You will work closely with our Leadership team to construct our product strategy. You will be the main product owner, owning the product plan, and be responsible for the product features and content planning and definition.
  
  

You will oversee product timelines, releases, scheduling, building processes, and QA of the whole game. You will prepare and provide accurate reports to management to ensure a tight delivery schedule and accurate overall production schedule. You will use your experience on the front lines to improve efficiencies, communication and quality. The Senior Producer will function as a main hub of information between the Programmers, Designers, Management and the rest of the company.
  
  

Also, you’ll be responsible to implement the monetization goals into a set of specific and detailed monetization measures, and follow through their implementation. You’ll be challenged to creatively tie things together: Connecting Skyweaver’s vision with our commercial targets, understanding the market and gamers we look to serve, and translate it into a product plan schedule you have built.
  
  

An understanding of what makes games fun and successful, will be crucial. As you guide the product team to deliver excellent interactive entertainment with cutting-edge blockchain technology, you’ll lean on your experience to ask the right questions. Who are the best performing cohorts? How might we improve retention? What features connect strongly with our strategy, and which others should we leave for now? You will be supported by a talented team to make it happen.

Your Role and Responsibilities  

**Who you are:**  

We are IBM ZOS (Z Operating System) - IBM Z Network Configuration Assistant Product team working on Z Enterprise Systems and we build the most secure systems for our Banking and Enterprise customers to deploy their mission critical applications. Also, We provide atmost security and Data management on Z systems. The mission critical applications run on zOS and The IBM® Configuration Assistant for z/OS® Communications Server, an optional GUI-based tool, provides a guided interface for configuring TCP/IP policy-based networking functions. You can use the IBM Configuration Assistant for z/OS Communications Server to generate the Policy Agent files.  

  

The IBM Configuration Assistant for z/OS Communications Server is a z/OS Management Facility (z/OSMF) task. z/OSMF provides a web browser interface for a variety of z/OS system management functions. When you invoke the IBM Configuration Assistant for z/OS Communications Server in z/OSMF, the IBM Configuration Assistant for z/OS Communications Server runs natively in the z/OS system and you can access it through a web browser.  

  

Through a series of wizards and online help panels, you can use the IBM Configuration Assistant for z/OS Communications Server to create AT-TLS configuration files for any number of z/OS images with any number of TCP/IP stacks per image. Using the IBM Configuration Assistant for z/OS Communications Server, there are three types of reusable objects:  

  

Traffic descriptors that define the local application, by describing the TCP traffic with ports or identifying the application using its jobname.  

Security levels that define the different ways to protect data, such as the encryption level.  

Requirement maps that map traffic descriptors to security levels. A single requirement map should contain a complete set of security requirements that will govern the level of security for multiple IP traffic types.  

  

For each TCP/IP stack, you create a set of connectivity rules that indicate the data endpoints and indicate which requirement map will govern security between the data endpoints.  

  

The IBM Configuration Assistant for z/OS Communications Server comes with a number of IBM-supplied traffic descriptors, security levels, and requirement maps that are easily applied, or you can use the IBM-supplied definitions as the basis for your own set of reusable objects.  

  

The IBM Configuration Assistant for z/OS Communications Server can dramatically reduce the amount of time that is required to create AT-TLS policy files, contributing to ease of configuration and maintenance. Because of the inherently complex nature of z/OS security, using the GUI can help you ensure that you have a consistent and easily manageable interface for implementing AT-TLS security.  

  

**What you’ll do:**  

To Build the world most secure system via Z systems which helps customers to deploy their application, also provide a platform to deploy Private Cloud, Stand alone systems hosting mission critical application, also to defend againist threats like Cyber Threats, etc and making the enablement experience quicker and easier.
