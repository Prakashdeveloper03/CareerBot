If you love being challenged by complex problems and are hungry for an opportunity to rapidly advance your skillset and career, Dew Wealth Management offers a collaborative and supportive culture that will invest in your professional development in equal measure to your investments in our clients’ success.

**About the Position**

If you’re looking for an opportunity to build out the nascent IT Department of an Inc. 5000 rapidly-growing organization, taking senior responsibility, not just for systems administration, but also for driving new initiatives designed to scale our IT infrastructure as this company grows from 34 employees to 100+ over the next few years, our IT Administrator (aka System Administrator) role may be for you.

Reporting directly to our , you will be the first full-time IT hire into this company, responsible for helping us reduce our independence on our outsourced IT vendor while also up-leveling (a) the technical support we can give our growing team of remote employees, and (b) the sophistication and scalability of our IT infrastructure. It’s an opportunity to play a pivotal role in building out the IT infrastructure of a rapidly growing company as it scales.

This is not an entry-level role. We’re looking for someone with significant experience in Office 365 network administration to come alongside us to up-level our IT architecture in a way that will help this company scale efficiently and securely. An ideal applicant would, therefore, have a degree in computer science, systems engineering, or network administration, as well as a Microsoft 365 Certification as a “Teams Administrator Associate” with an “Administrator Expert” certification being preferred. With that said, we understand that many of the most talented IT professionals took career paths that didn’t go through traditional educational institutions, nor have they prioritized chasing Microsoft certification to validate skills they have acquired through experience. So, if it’s possible for you to quickly get the aforementioned Microsoft Certifications, that would enhance your application. But we will give all applicants an opportunity to demonstrate their skills and experience throughout this process, even if they don’t check all the rigid academic and certification boxes that would be ideal.

This is a fully remote role. Approximately four times per year, we will pay you to fly out to our headquarters in Scottsdale, AZ to get an opportunity to connect with your colleagues in person and align on quarterly objectives.

Notwithstanding the virtual nature of our model, at present, we are only hiring applicants who reside within the continental United States (excluding CA) to minimize HR and tax complexities and to keep our team within four time zones of each other.

**Key Responsibilities**

Provide administrative and technical support for all IT assets within our diverse tech stack.

Before we opened Strive Pharmacy we were unsatisfied with the current state of the pharmaceutical industry. Most of the current pharmaceuticals only offer a one size fits all approach and often come with unwanted and potentially dangerous side effects. We found that through compounding we can offer a much more personalized solution to medicine.



Through this we have been able to help patients get the results they are seeking for their personal needs. After years of working for corporate chains we took the risk and opened Strive Pharmacy. We are dedicated to providing a better experience for each customer and clinic that we work with. Come see the Strive difference.


### **Our Mission**

'The human element' is our crux and catalyst, driving all that we do, whether we're interacting with patients, providers, or practices. We're here to partner with those ready for a change. More than a compounding pharmacy, we're on a mission to positively disrupt healthcare as we know it. Strive is about more than medicine. Strive is about striving for the personal side of healthcare.

Infrastructure Specialists at Kyndryl are project-based subject matter experts in all things infrastructure – good at providing analysis, documenting and diagraming work for hand-off, offering timely solutions, and generally “figuring it out.” This is a hands-on role where your feel for the interaction between a system and its environment will be invaluable to every one of your clients.  

  

There are two halves to this role: First, contributing to current projects where you analyze problems and tech issues, offer solutions, and test, modify, automate, and integrate systems. And second, long-range strategic planning of IT infrastructure and operational execution. This role isn’t specific to any one platform, so you’ll need a good feel for all of them. And because of this, you’ll experience variety and growth at Kyndryl that you won’t find anywhere else.  

  

You’ll be involved early to offer solutions, help decide whether something can be done, and identify the technical and timeline risks up front. This means dealing with both client expectations and internal challenges – in other words, there are plenty of opportunities to make a difference, and a lot of people will witness your contributions. In fact, a frequent sign of success for our Infrastructure Specialists is when clients come back to us and ask for the same person by name. That’s the kind of impact you can have!  

  

This is a project-based role where you’ll enjoy deep involvement throughout the lifespan of a project, as well as the chance to work closely with Architects, Technicians, and PMs. Whatever your current level of tech savvy or where you want your career to lead, you’ll find the right opportunities and a buddy to support your growth. Boredom? Trust us, that won’t be an issue.  

  

Your future at Kyndryl  

There are lots of opportunities to gain certification and qualifications on the job, and you’ll continuously grow as a Cloud Hyperscaler. Many of our Infrastructure Specialists are on a path toward becoming either an Architect or Distinguished Engineer, and there are opportunities at every skill level to grow in either of these directions.
