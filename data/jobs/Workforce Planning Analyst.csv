The experience acquired in one of these early career roles can lay the groundwork for future success in frontline fundraising, planned giving work, more advanced analytical roles, or in fundraising operations administration. UDAR at UCSF offers some of the most competitive salaries in the entire University of California system, equity-based pay, a flexible hybrid-remote work environment, mentorship/extended learning opportunities, and staff engagement opportunities, including through our Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, Accessibility (DEIA+) work.  

  

The Gift & Endowment Planning (GEP) team is looking for a Development Analyst who meets the above criteria and who also has an interest in planned giving. The GEP Team plays an integral role in UDAR’s fundraising efforts, serving as in-house representative in planned giving (gifts donors make through their wills or various other gift vehicles); advising prospects, donors and UDAR staff; drafting gift agreements; administering bequests from trusts and estates; and allocating bequests within UCSF. In short, GEP serves as a resource in all aspects of gift planning for donors, prospects, staff and outside professionals and provides information, advice and strategies for planned gifts as part of the solicitation and stewardship of those gifts, as well as the UCSF portion of the administration of trust and estate gifts. Over half of our team members have a law degree, therefore interested applicants with a legal background might find this opportunity a unique way to utilize a similar skill set.  

  

A successful hire will play a key role in GEP team’s efforts to solicit, secure and steward planned gifts for UCSF as well as supporting UDAR’s major gift fundraising efforts. The GEP analyst position calls for acumen, awareness, and diplomacy; understanding of the relationship-building strategies involved in securing both planned gifts and major gifts; and talent in managing project work in support of these efforts. Under the direction of the GEP Executive Director, this role will manage and triage workflow supporting GEP’s frontline staff so that they are optimizing time devising and implementing gift strategies, soliciting, securing, and stewarding planned gifts, efficiently administering Estates Under Administration, and partnering with UDAR fundraisers and UCSF campus colleagues to secure major gifts for UCSF.  

  

In the first month, you will familiarize yourself with the work of the Gift & Endowment Planning team, and you will learn about the patient care, research, education, and public service missions of UCSF while attaining a basic working knowledge of UDAR and UCSF systems such as our donor database and the systems and technology that support our day-to-day work.  

  

In the first three months, you will have a sense of GEP’s workflow, you will familiarize yourself with UDAR’s Salesforce database with special attention to GEP’s work ensuring that planned gifts are correctly allocated, and that donor activity is accurately recorded.  

  

In the first six months, you will have seamlessly integrated yourself into the GEP team and will be making daily contributions to our productivity, for example, by providing team members with sought after data from the database, accurately & efficiently triaging donor inquiries, and proactively addressing issues that arise which impede GEP’s productivity.  

  

At the end of your the first year, you will have developed relationships with colleagues across UDAR, you will be doing your day-to-day work with minimal guidance from others and will be a resource both for colleagues within the GEP team and in UDAR. You will be providing key reporting and logistical support in areas such as estate administration and donor stewardship that will translate directly to new gifts as well as increased donor & prospect activity across GEP. **To see the salary range for this position (we recommend that you make a note of the job code and use that to look up):** TCS Non-Academic Titles Search (ucop.edu)
