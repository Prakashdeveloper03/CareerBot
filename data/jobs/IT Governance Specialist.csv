**About Us:**  

  

Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc. (CIL) is the world’s leading producer of stable isotopes and stable isotope-labeled compounds. With approximately 750 employees and laboratories in four countries, CIL specializes in the process of labeling biochemical and organic compounds with highly enriched, stable (nonradioactive) isotopes of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen. Our chemists substitute common atoms (e.g., 1H, 12C, 14N, 16O) with rare, highly valued isotopes (e.g., 2H or D, 13C, 15N, 18O) so that the final product can be readily measured or traced using mass spectrometry (MS) or nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). CIL’s products are utilized in laboratories, medical, government and academic research centers and health care facilities worldwide.


We are proud that CIL products have contributed to medical advancements in cancer research, new-drug development, environmental analysis, and medical diagnostic research. In the past decade, as the fields of proteomics and metabolomics have developed as leading techniques for determining biomarkers for disease presence, progression and the monitoring of therapeutic response, CIL has worked closely with industry leaders and researchers to provide the stable isotope-labeled tools needed for improved quantitation and qualification of complex biological systems.


After decades of research, stable isotopes have found their place in an ever expanding commercial scale applications in pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, flat panel displays as well as other high technology fields specifically with deuterium oxide (D2O) and deuterium gases. Pharmaceutical companies have begun to investigate deuteration of molecules that may provide advantages over their existing nondeuterated counterparts. In addition, increasing research into the potential medical advantages of new deuterated drugs is also occurring. In high technology, deuterated organic molecules and deuterium gas are commonly used in the manufacturing of microelectronics and OLEDs, which contribute to the increased lifetime of the devices.

* Core Data Products: responsible to define the vision, scope, plan and ultimate execution and adoption of a portfolio of data products; building on the current ‘organization intelligence’ data product capability (with approx. 30FTE) this portfolio could grow significantly depending on the creation of demonstrable value from further investment in core data products.

The Clinton Health Access Initiative, Inc. (CHAI) is a global health organization committed to our mission of saving lives and reducing the burden of disease in low-and middle-income countries. We work at the invitation of governments to support them and the private sector to create and sustain high-quality health systems.  

CHAI was founded in 2002 in response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic with the goal of dramatically reducing the price of life-saving drugs and increasing access to these medicines in the countries with the highest burden of the disease. Over the following two decades, CHAI has expanded its focus. Today, along with HIV, we work in conjunction with our partners to prevent and treat infectious diseases such as COVID-19, malaria, tuberculosis, and hepatitis. Our work has also expanded into cancer, diabetes, hypertension, and other non-communicable diseases, and we work to accelerate the rollout of lifesaving vaccines, reduce maternal and child mortality, combat chronic malnutrition, and increase access to assistive technology. We are investing in horizontal approaches to strengthen health systems through programs in human resources for health, digital health, and health financing. With each new and innovative program, our strategy is grounded in maximizing sustainable impact at scale, ensuring that governments lead the solutions, that programs are designed to scale nationally, and learnings are shared globally.  

At CHAI, our people are our greatest asset, and none of this work would be possible without their talent, time, dedication and passion for our mission and values. We are a highly diverse team of enthusiastic individuals across 40 countries with a broad range of skillsets and life experiences. CHAI is deeply grounded in the countries we work in, with most of our staff based in program countries.  

In India, CHAI works in partnership with its India registered affiliate William J Clinton Foundation (WJCF) under the guidance of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) at the Central and States' levels on an array of high priority initiatives aimed at improving health outcomes. Currently, WJCF supports government partners across projects to expand access to quality care and treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis, tuberculosis, COVID-19, common cancers, sexual and reproductive health, immunization, and essential medicines.  

Learn more about our exciting work: http://www.clintonhealthaccess.org **Project Background:**
Launched nation-wide in September 2021, the Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM) seeks to power India’s quest for Universal Health Coverage by creating the interoperability required for health information and records to be exchanged seamlessly across digital platforms, leading over time to improved access, quality and affordability of health services. Central to ABDM is the concept of a health account (Ayushman Bharat Health Account or ABHA). An individual with an ABHA can link their personal health and / or medical records to this account, and provide their consent to share their records with any other system that is ABDM-enabled. For instance, if they have been referred to a specialist for a consultation, they may provide them with access to diagnostic and other records that provide the specialist a comprehensive view of their medical history.  

The National Health Authority (NHA), an autonomous government institution manages the implementation of ABDM across the country. There has been tremendous progress so far, with 560+ million ABHA created, ~230,000 health facilities and ~275,000 health professionals registered. With 175+ health systems and apps ABDM-enabled, and the introduction of functionalities such as ‘scan and share’ for OPD registration, usage is deepening as well, with over 345 million health records already linked to ABHAs.[1] With new platforms powered by ABDM such as the Unified Health Interface (UHI) and Health Claims Exchanged (HCX) being introduced, the health ecosystem in India is poised to fully leverage ABDM’s potential.  

WJCF has been supporting the operationalization and roll-out of ABDM since January 2021, working closely with and under the guidance of the NHA. Our has been on driving adoption of ABDM among healthcare providers, especially private sector physicians. A key constituency in the private sector are doctors, who are not only the main ‘consumers’ of health and medical records (on the basis of which they make their diagnoses and prescribe care) but also the main ‘producers’ of these records.**Position Summary:**


WJCF will support Maharashtra in driving adoption of ABDM in the private sector, as the Development Partner under the NHA’s ‘100 Microsites’ initiative. Our primary responsibilities include building capacity of the field staff deployed by the ‘Interfacing Agency’ and supporting the State ABDM Office in monitoring progress and reporting to the NHA. Apart from the three key stakeholders (State ABDM Office, Interfacing Agency and the NHA), we will also work closely and collaboratively with multiple stakeholders, including state-and-district level authorities, statutory bodies such as medical commissions, professional associations, and of course, the healthcare professionals themselves.

  

WJCF is looking to hire a*n Analyst* to work in close collaboration with the Maharashtra State ABDM Office in Mumbai and support the Interfacing Agencies working for the implementation of microsites to help drive adoption of ABDM among healthcare professionals in the state. A particular focus of this role is to support the State ABDM Office in widening their engagement with healthcare professionals by leveraging various existing platforms such as medical conferences, digital health events, and such others and deepen the engagement with the healthcare professionals through implementation of microsites.

  

The microsite approach to adoption is important for the ABDM ecosystem in two main ways:

* By engaging deeply with an ecosystem of providers, it helps catalyse demand for ABDM through a ‘flywheel’ effect - demonstrating the value of ABDM to all stakeholders, thereby jump-starting wider demand-based adoption.
* As sites for learning and experimentation, microsites deepen the ABDM ecosystem’s understanding of attitudes, incentives and circumstances that can drive or hinder adoption of ABDM, thereby helping to identify new use cases and sharpen its value proposition.


This role provides an opportunity to be at the heart of and directly influence the nascent and fast-moving digital health journey in India. While based out of the State ABDM Office in Mumbai, the successful candidate will work closely with our Program Officer who is based in Nagpur and our ABDM Adoption team based out of the NHA.

* Systematically monitoring progress, documenting, and distilling insights and reporting for the microsite(s) implemented in
* Liaising with stakeholders such as the (i) Information, Education and Communication (IEC) team at NHA, and (ii) Various ABDM-enabled IT solution providers to ensure that field team (hired by the interfacing agency) is enabled to provide up-to-date and accurate information to healthcare professionals and to ensure a smooth onboarding process.
* Report all issue(s) as identified on field (technical/ procedural) to (i) State ABDM office, (ii) NHA in a concise manner. Ensure that issues are resolved and timely action is taken.
* Supporting SAO to identify and participate in medical conferences, workshops, and CME sessions to convey benefits of becoming a part of the ABDM ecosystem.
* Engaging professional bodies and associations of healthcare professionals to leverage their existing communication channels (sessions, newsletters, magazines, blogposts, and such others) for spreading awareness about ABDM among their members.
* Working closely with communication and research partners to sharpen the articulation and methods of conveying the value proposition of ABDM to healthcare professionals.
* Exploring other innovative ways to reach out and engage healthcare professionals to enable them to participate in India’s digital health journey.
