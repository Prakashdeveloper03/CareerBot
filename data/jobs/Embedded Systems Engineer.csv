-----------------------


Since we opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely, and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take payments and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together.  

  

So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, offer buy now, pay later functionality through Afterpay, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. Across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow in one place. Afterpay furthers our goal to provide omnichannel tools that unlock meaningful value and growth, enabling sellers to capture the next generation shopper, increase order sizes, and compete at a larger scale.  

  

Today, we are a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex operations, sellers just starting, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers grow, so do our solutions. There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a significant, meaningful, and lasting business, and we are helping sellers worldwide do the same.**Job Description**
-------------------


Square Invoices is the easiest way for merchants to close sales and collect payments remotely. Our customers rely on our products because they are well-designed, easy to use, and integrated with their business.

You’ll contribute to the roadmap and strategy decisions and will play a critical role in helping the team accomplish our industry-leading growth goals.


On the Invoices Front Door team, we focus on supporting advanced workflows for upmarket sellers who tend to have a longer sales lifecycle compared to in person sales. Invoices is unique to Square in that we can flex our products to be used complementary to sellers main point of sale, or serve as a complete business and payments stack solution. Our team is focused, fast-moving, and rapidly growing with an abundance of growth and impact opportunities. We focus on building the best tools to help our merchants close sales and get paid quickly. We are doing this in an efficient and scalable way, by automating critical functions for our merchants.

If you're a design leader who likes the challenge of maturing a team, here are some things to get excited about:


* We're helping small and medium-sized companies grow their businesses with our billing/invoicing tools and payments processing solutions

At Philo, we're a group of technology and product people who set out to build the future of television, marrying the best in modern technology with the most compelling medium ever invented — in short, we're building the TV experience that we've always wanted for ourselves. In practice this means leveraging cloud delivery, modern tech stacks, machine learning, and hand-crafted native app experiences on all of our platforms. We aim to deliver a rock solid experience on the streaming basics, while cooking up next generation multi-screen and multi-user playback experiences.


**Kotlin Multiplatform at Philo**

The Kotlin Multiplatform team creates and maintains a shared business logic layer that is used across 9+ platforms (e.g. iOS, Tizen, FireTV, Web, Chromecast, etc.). We're building the libraries that respond to user input and tell our UI what it should display on 10s of millions of devices, which are collectively responsible for a huge fraction of the billions of minutes watched on Philo each year.



Currently, our Kotlin Multiplatform libraries power our video player, our casting functionality (Philo Connect), and analytics, but we're in the process of expanding them to cover even more of our app functionality. We leverage the MVI pattern, but our views are outside of the KMM codebase, since we believe UI should be left to the ""native"" code.



We are a small but growing team of tinkerers, who are comfortable at every level of the frontend stack. On a given day, you might be diving into the details of Kotlin's `iconv` wrappers, profiling changes to the JS network stack, or writing clean maintainable code that captures complex business logic.



We're skeptics at Philo - in general, we prefer ""boring and battle tested"" over ""shiny and nascent."" With that said, we also try to use the best tool for the job, and when that tool does not yet exist, we're not opposed to building it (or contributing to the projects that are building it). Kotlin Multiplatform falls solidly into the second category, and to make it work for our use-case we need to be unafraid of tackling seemingly insurmountable problems. We're actively working on a number of open source projects to improve the ecosystem and make it usable for all.



Philo engineers own what they build from start to finish and are passionate about continuously delivering delightful features to a huge user base. If you're a Kotlin hacker who cares deeply about writing quality code and using the latest tools & technologies to push the envelope of what's possible, we would love to talk to you!


**A strong candidate is:**


* 8+ years of experience working on frontend app development
* Extremely proficient in Kotlin
* Deeply experienced with structured concurrency and coroutines
* Experienced with Redux/MVI-like patterns
* Familiar with the Android ecosystem, including feature sets and best practices across devices and operating system versions
* Familiar with web technologies, and able to proficiently write and debug JS-based applications
* Familiar with Swift, Objective-C, and the Apple ecosystem


**Nice to have:**


* A good instinct for product design and UX. Able to take mocks and bring them to life
* Experience with embedded programming and/or working on highly resourced constrained devices
* Experience with video playback
* Experience with GraphQL-based APIs


**Interview Process**



Step 1: Back-to-Back Calls. A Recruiter Call to learn more about the role and Philo, then an Engineering Call with a KMP Engineer to learn more about your technical background, and to tell you more about our codebase.



Step 2: Technical Screen. For this role, the technical screen will consist of a ""take-home"" exercise to be completed in Kotlin. The exercise will involve concurrency and socket programming. Note that if you are the maintainer of a major open source project, this step may be skipped at the discretion of the hiring manager.



Step 3: Virtual Onsite. This will consist of five interviews: (1) A demo of our product; (2) a paired programming session where we fix bugs and improve the exercise you submitted during the technical screener; (3) a product-focused interview with a member of our product team; (4); a technical architecture interview that will involve some software design discussions; (5) a soft skills interview.



Step 4: Follow Up Call with Hiring Manager. The hiring manager will collect feedback about the process, and cover any follow ups that interviewers had throughout the rest of the process.


**More about Philo**



We strive to build engaging and easy to use streaming apps across a large number of platforms (Android Mobile, Android tablets, Android TV, Amazon Fire TV, Roku, iOS, Apple TV, and web), while delivering a large variety of content to our users.

As a Product Manager embedded in our **Data Sciences Software** division you belong to the functional team whose work encompasses product strategy, product delivery, product management & product operations. You and your colleagues in Product Management specifically are charged with:
—Targeting R&D investments towards maximum value for customers and business ROI.
—Being accountable for decision-making, problem selection, and business outcomes.
—Guiding product lifecycle from ideation to development to go-to-market to scaled product-market-fit.  

This role requires skillsets, experience, and competencies in:
—**Execution & Delivery**: Cross-team Collaboration, Judgement & Decision Making, Responsibility for Outcomes
—**Research & Strategy**: Stakeholder Engagement, Data & Market Analysis, Thought Leadership  

  

This specific Product Manager role is for our **Certara Cloud & Platform Integrations** team.  

—Certara owns and develops over a dozen Software-as-a-Service offerings, some of which we obtained via M&A and some of which we built and launched organically. In January 2024, we launched Certara Cloud, the unifying platform that connects our offerings with a single Certara ID, and lays the groundwork for seamless integration and interconnected product-product workflows across our ecosystem.  

—This team's main goal is to discover and enforce true synergies across our portfolio of products, following a ""build once, use many times"" mentality by elevating ""shared services"" out of individual products, and promoting them into our platform layer, from which all products may benefit via our rich set of internal APIs. The more robust our platform becomes, the more each specialty product can focus on its unique scientific area, and the more quickly we can launch net new products without having to reinvent generic architecture each time.  

—This role will likely see the most success with candidates who are both 1) extremely technical in their understanding of engineering, security, APIs, forward/backward compatibility, 3rd party integrations, data models, and infrastructure, and 2) extremely communicative in their journey across all of our internal product teams to ""cross-shop"" ideas and coordinate across divisions with otherwise siloed teams.  

—This team's character is very self-starting and entrepreneurial, forging paths through Certara's inner workings and across our massive and varied client base at a fast pace. Since the platform is the hub of many other products, the platform's release cycle is the most rapid in our company, and your ability to make robust decisions quickly (despite imperfect information), plus your ability to evaluate risks and make smart tradeoffs, are critical.  

—We are also in a unique position, in that many hundreds of our internal staff are themselves scientists and domain experts who use our SaaS offerings to perform consulting work on behalf of our biopharmaceutical clients. So we benefit from intense ""dogfooding,"" in that we ourselves use our own products, and iterate quickly based on tight feedback loops that are rare in B2B SaaS in the biopharmaceutical space.  

Responsibilities:
**Execution & Delivery**  

Cross-team Collaboration  

—Fluidly navigates the software development process and reviews the work of engineers and test engineers against self-written success criteria  

—Peer-reviews others' ideas, with strong sense of internal/external impacts/risks/constraints, resulting in profitable rewrites.  

Judgement & Decision Making  

—Invents requirements for user stories of large value  

—Documents client use cases, decisions, and business logic to allow full visibility for the team, keeping pace with evolving, complex, domain-specific and technical requirements, extending to cross-product integrations  

—Translates leaders' product visions into actionable priorities and counter-proposes compelling priorities  

—Frames decisions with clear objectives and context, trading off well among internal vs external stakeholder needs and long-term vs short-term goals.  

Responsibility for Outcomes  

—Deliberate in proposing resource investments and achieves outcomes, including ownership of metrics such as near-term project budget and long-term user adoption. **Research & Strategy**  

Stakeholder Engagement  

—Without prompting, interviews clients with deep counter-questioning that reveals their out-of-product workflows and offers insightful conclusions—vetting those conclusions against hard data.  

Data & Market Analysis  

—Instruments and interprets new product data analytics from multiple sources, and deeply parses competitors' offerings, to measure impact of past and present R&D efforts—with ability to pinpoint success factors.  

Thought Leadership  

—Explains the product when called upon to internal (e.g., sales) audiences and clients via semi-structured live demos  

—Attends tradeshows to showcase offerings and produces at least one publication or presentation per year (company webinars, industry journals, 3rd party conferences, etc.)
Qualifications:

Must Have  

—Fastidious for facts, insistent on evidence- and data-driven choices, able to separate signal from noise  

—Systems-thinking and ability to predict or extrapolate to second, third, and fourth order effects (if A, then B, then C, then D…)  

—Adept at analytics, independent research, unscripted interviews, and other intel-gathering techniques  

—Not afraid to speak up and veto a bad idea, or have your ideas vetoed (our default is “NO”) in favor of what our team decided to prioritize next  

—Curious about our clients and products, cautious with our brand and industry goodwill, conscientious in follow-through  

—Willing to learn and serve, flexible in adapting to rapid organizational change, receptive of constructive criticism  

—High tolerance for ambiguity, low tolerance for mess; able to create order out of chaos, attend to details, and push quality higher
  

—Relentlessly resourceful and discerning in solving problems independently vs. seeking help from others; brave yet humble in working across multi-disciplinary teams where each person is more of an expert than you in their chosen field  

Preferred  

—Intimate familiarity with a specific scientific domain, such as biosimulation, PK/PD modelling, clinical trial data standardization and analysis, etc.  

—Ability to work in a remote position requiring constant spoken and written communication; skill in exerting influence (even on company founders, owners, and partners) without leverage or managerial authority  

—Education or qualifications relating to business, programming, data science, health sciences, medical writing, customer support, project management, or corporate communications  

—Experience working for a software-as-a-service (SaaS) vendor, clinical laboratory, pharmaceutical company, or Contract Research Organization (CRO) *Certara bases all employment-related decision on merit, taking into consideration qualifications, skills, achievement, and performance. We treat all applicants and employees without regard to personal characteristics such as race, color, ethnicity, religion, sex, sexual orientation, age, nationality, marital status, pregnancy, physical or mental condition, genetic information, military service, or other characteristic protected by law.*"
