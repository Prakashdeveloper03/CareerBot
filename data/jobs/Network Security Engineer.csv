Quiet is a free software, peer-to-peer alternative to Slack and Discord. We’re building it because we believe most Internet users will only escape Big Tech and “the cloud” once free software can connect the devices they control (their phones, their laptops) to provide full-featured online spaces for work and community life, with no server required.

We’re hiring a senior software engineer to help us prove that using free software for communication and collaboration doesn’t need to mean trusting someone else’s server or running one’s own.

It’s an exciting time for peer-to-peer communication tools; they aren’t pipe dreams anymore! Tools like IPFS, libp2p, [CRDTs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free\\_replicated\\_data\\_type) like Automerge, and overlay networks like Tor do a lot of the heavy lifting, making it easier for teams to focus on the mix of features, reliability, and security properties real users need.

We think Quiet is the farthest along among comparable projects, but there’s still a ton of work to be done. Quiet has working releases for desktop and Android, and iOS is very close. We use Quiet internally for our team chat, but we have tricky reliability improvements to make—as well as a ton of features to build—before most real teams or communities could use Quiet daily as a Slack substitute.

Your role will be to help us move surefooted, with urgency, through features and stack-level challenges.

**About you**

* 5+ years of experience delivering user-facing software in a high-stakes setting
* Experienced delivering software products for desktop and/or mobile
* Can mentor and guide other engineers
* Prepared to contribute immediately to our Electron, React, React Native, Node.js, TypeScript project. (We use React Native with a Node.js backend on mobile.)
* Familiar with test-driven development; ready to work with tools like Jest, React Testing Library, Chromatic, Cypress, and WebDriver
* Ready to assess new tools and research in the peer-to-peer, local-first space for applicability to challenges we face
* Experienced enough with how software projects play out over time to help us navigate risk and scope for the long term
* Ready to work in US or European time zones

**Not required, but a plus**

* Experience with peer-to-peer or local-first software
* Experience with security
* Experience building high-availability web apps at scale
* Expertise in one of the technologies we build on: Tor, IPFS, libp2p, or distributed databases, and readiness to become an expert in the others
* Contributions to one of these projects, or a similar project

**What we offer**

* 100% remote with regular in-person retreats and meetings
* An option of in-person work in the northeast U.S.
* Salary $60-$160k depending on experience
* Equity
* Unlimited PTO

*Quiet is an equal opportunity employer. All applicants will be considered for employment regardless of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, veteran or disability status.

Security
Netflix is the world's leading streaming entertainment service with 200+ million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, documentaries, and feature films across a wide variety of genres and languages. This is made possible, in part, by an engineering organization that enables our customers to stream content and our studio to produce content.  

The Security Services Engineering organization supports the Netflix workforce by creating and operating authentication, authorization, and cryptographic software services. Our IAM use cases will continue to become more complex as we increase investment in Netflix Originals content production ecosystems, including Gaming. Our workforce and partners are global, and they access our information with different patterns from a variety of locations and devices. With security and ease of information access for our fast-paced growth in mind, we realize that the traditional corporate network security perimeter no longer meets our requirements. Instead, we invest in Identity as a perimeter in the open internet, with reliable and strong authentication and authorization service to protect our information.  

The Role
This role is a unique opportunity to contribute to architecting and building identity and access security services and solutions! You will be part of the Identity Integrations and Solutions Engineering (IISE) team, focusing on core Identity Lifecycle Management, Consultation and Solutions to support all of the Netflix ecosystem (Enterprise, Studio and Gaming). You will play a critical role in security function with experience in software engineering including Identity system and solutions design, implementation, partner integration, and rollout strategy for some of our foundational services and IAM solution which includes but is not limited to fine grain access controls, policy driven security, identity governance, access management, privileged access management, user provisioning/deprovisioning, and federation.
If you are curious about some of the team’s work, you can watch this Building Identity for an Open Perimeter conference talk by our IAM engineers. Another recommended read is this blog post about how product and application security operates in the Netflix culture.**What you’ll need to be successful:**
--------------------------------------

* You are a pragmatic security engineer with a proven track record of building, operating and contributing to architecture of complex Identity Lifecycle and Access Control solutions.
* Strong IAM fundamentals - AAA (Authentication, Authorization, Accountability), and Identity lifecycle
* Experience working with authentication and authorization protocols/frameworks (OpenID Connect, SCIM, OAuth, SAML, AD/LDAP, Federation, SSO).

We are IBM ZOS (Z Operating System) - IBM Z Network Configuration Assistant Product team working on Z Enterprise Systems and we build the most secure systems for our Banking and Enterprise customers to deploy their mission critical applications. Also, We provide atmost security and Data management on Z systems. The mission critical applications run on zOS and The IBM® Configuration Assistant for z/OS® Communications Server, an optional GUI-based tool, provides a guided interface for configuring TCP/IP policy-based networking functions. You can use the IBM Configuration Assistant for z/OS Communications Server to generate the Policy Agent files.  

  

The IBM Configuration Assistant for z/OS Communications Server is a z/OS Management Facility (z/OSMF) task. z/OSMF provides a web browser interface for a variety of z/OS system management functions. When you invoke the IBM Configuration Assistant for z/OS Communications Server in z/OSMF, the IBM Configuration Assistant for z/OS Communications Server runs natively in the z/OS system and you can access it through a web browser.  

  

Through a series of wizards and online help panels, you can use the IBM Configuration Assistant for z/OS Communications Server to create AT-TLS configuration files for any number of z/OS images with any number of TCP/IP stacks per image. Using the IBM Configuration Assistant for z/OS Communications Server, there are three types of reusable objects:  

  

Traffic descriptors that define the local application, by describing the TCP traffic with ports or identifying the application using its jobname.  

Security levels that define the different ways to protect data, such as the encryption level.  

Requirement maps that map traffic descriptors to security levels. A single requirement map should contain a complete set of security requirements that will govern the level of security for multiple IP traffic types.  

  

For each TCP/IP stack, you create a set of connectivity rules that indicate the data endpoints and indicate which requirement map will govern security between the data endpoints.  

  

The IBM Configuration Assistant for z/OS Communications Server comes with a number of IBM-supplied traffic descriptors, security levels, and requirement maps that are easily applied, or you can use the IBM-supplied definitions as the basis for your own set of reusable objects.  

  

The IBM Configuration Assistant for z/OS Communications Server can dramatically reduce the amount of time that is required to create AT-TLS policy files, contributing to ease of configuration and maintenance. Because of the inherently complex nature of z/OS security, using the GUI can help you ensure that you have a consistent and easily manageable interface for implementing AT-TLS security.
