The School of Humanities and Sciences (H&S) is the foundation of a liberal arts education at Stanford. The school encompasses 24 departments and 25 interdisciplinary programs. H&S is home to fundamental and applied research, where free, open, and critical inquiry is pursued across disciplines. As the university’s largest school, H&S serves as the foundation of a Stanford undergraduate education no matter which discipline students pursue as a major. Graduate students work alongside world-renowned faculty to pursue and shape foundational research that leads to breakthroughs and discoveries that shed new light on the past, influence the present, and shape the future. Together, faculty and students in H&S engage in inspirational teaching, learning, and research every day.


**Position Summary:**



Stanfordʼs School of Humanities and Sciences Information Technology team (H&S IT) is seeking an **Organizational Insight Analyst.** This is a newly created position on our team, which will play an instrumental role in bolstering our strategic objectives. The incumbent will perform in-depth analysis, typically focused on vexing problems and complex processes. The analysis will support data-driven decision-making, which will contribute to our ability to transform H&S IT processes, systems, and services. Some analysis will be quantitative, requiring data gathering from disparate data sources, normalizing and joining the data, performing statistical operations, finding patterns and anomalies, and telling a compelling story through visualizations and numeric/statistical reports. Other analysis will be qualitative, requiring synthesis of unstructured textual information from various sources such as policy documents, workflow documents, and business process guides, and telling a compelling story through narrative. The incumbent will also manage a select set of IT service management operations and processes.



H&S IT is part of the H&S Deanʼs Oﬀice (HSDO). We support the mission and operations of the School of Humanities and Sciences by developing and supporting IT processes, applications, and systems. H&S IT consists of three-sub teams: H&S IT Application Services which supports applications and data systems; H&S IT Web Services which supports web content management systems and digital accessibility eﬀorts; and H&S IT Operations which supports other technology services and processes that keep our schoolʼs everyday IT running smoothly. The Organizational Insight Analyst works on the H&S IT Operations team and reports directly to the H&S Chief Information Oﬀicer.



Stanford has a highly decentralized IT organizational structure. In some cases H&S IT wholly owns and supports IT systems specific to the School of Humanities and Sciences. In other cases H&S IT provides local support to H&S for the IT systems/projects that are owned by other campus IT organizations. And in other cases yet, H&S IT is far removed from the technology support processes but we advocate for H&S users and we reduce friction by getting them to the right place to get their needs met quickly. The Stanford technology stacks are equally complex, with an expanse of applications, systems, databases, integrations, and processes. Itʼs up to H&S IT to determine how/where we can leverage those systems individually and collectively to meet H&S needs. The Organizational Insight Analyst will contribute to these eﬀorts.



This is 100% FTE, continuing, exempt position. H&S IT is a remote work team that maintains core business hours during Pacific Time. All team members are required to convene together tri-annually on Stanfordʼs historic campus for 3-5 days to perform in-person planning and collaboration activities.

To be considered, please submit an online application and include a cover letter, résumé, and (optionally) a link to your online portfolio of work samples if available.
