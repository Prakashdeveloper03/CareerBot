**About the Position**

If you’re looking for an opportunity to build out the nascent IT Department of an Inc. 5000 rapidly-growing organization, taking senior responsibility, not just for systems administration, but also for driving new initiatives designed to scale our IT infrastructure as this company grows from 34 employees to 100+ over the next few years, our IT Administrator (aka System Administrator) role may be for you.

Reporting directly to our , you will be the first full-time IT hire into this company, responsible for helping us reduce our independence on our outsourced IT vendor while also up-leveling (a) the technical support we can give our growing team of remote employees, and (b) the sophistication and scalability of our IT infrastructure. It’s an opportunity to play a pivotal role in building out the IT infrastructure of a rapidly growing company as it scales.

An ideal applicant would, therefore, have a degree in computer science, systems engineering, or network administration, as well as a Microsoft 365 Certification as a “Teams Administrator Associate” with an “Administrator Expert” certification being preferred. With that said, we understand that many of the most talented IT professionals took career paths that didn’t go through traditional educational institutions, nor have they prioritized chasing Microsoft certification to validate skills they have acquired through experience.
