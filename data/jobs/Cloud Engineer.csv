Quiet is a free software, peer-to-peer alternative to Slack and Discord. We’re building it because we believe most Internet users will only escape Big Tech and “the cloud” once free software can connect the devices they control (their phones, their laptops) to provide full-featured online spaces for work and community life, with no server required.

We’re hiring a senior software engineer to help us prove that using free software for communication and collaboration doesn’t need to mean trusting someone else’s server or running one’s own.

It’s an exciting time for peer-to-peer communication tools; they aren’t pipe dreams anymore! Tools like IPFS, libp2p, [CRDTs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free\\_replicated\\_data\\_type) like Automerge, and overlay networks like Tor do a lot of the heavy lifting, making it easier for teams to focus on the mix of features, reliability, and security properties real users need.

We think Quiet is the farthest along among comparable projects, but there’s still a ton of work to be done. Quiet has working releases for desktop and Android, and iOS is very close. We use Quiet internally for our team chat, but we have tricky reliability improvements to make—as well as a ton of features to build—before most real teams or communities could use Quiet daily as a Slack substitute.

Your role will be to help us move surefooted, with urgency, through features and stack-level challenges.

**About you**

* 5+ years of experience delivering user-facing software in a high-stakes setting
* Experienced delivering software products for desktop and/or mobile
* Can mentor and guide other engineers
* Prepared to contribute immediately to our Electron, React, React Native, Node.js, TypeScript project. (We use React Native with a Node.js backend on mobile.)
* Familiar with test-driven development; ready to work with tools like Jest, React Testing Library, Chromatic, Cypress, and WebDriver
* Ready to assess new tools and research in the peer-to-peer, local-first space for applicability to challenges we face
* Experienced enough with how software projects play out over time to help us navigate risk and scope for the long term
* Ready to work in US or European time zones

**Not required, but a plus**

* Experience with peer-to-peer or local-first software
* Experience with security
* Experience building high-availability web apps at scale
* Expertise in one of the technologies we build on: Tor, IPFS, libp2p, or distributed databases, and readiness to become an expert in the others
* Contributions to one of these projects, or a similar project

**What we offer**

* 100% remote with regular in-person retreats and meetings

*Quiet is an equal opportunity employer.

Core Engineering
Netflix is one of the world's leading streaming entertainment services with over 260 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, films and games across a wide variety of genres and languages. Members can play, pause and resume watching as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, and can change their plans at any time.  

Netflix has been on the leading edge of the cloud since beginning the migration to AWS 15 years ago and runs one of the largest Cloud footprints around. The Cloud Engineering organization exists to manage that massive scale, constantly innovating to increase fleet-wide agility, efficiency, and reliability of the Netflix cloud infrastructure, while solving scale problems that we are the first to ever hit. We build, operate, and maintain Compute, Network and Storage services so that developers at Netflix can rely on foundational building blocks when entertaining hundreds of millions of customers around the world. Join us as we push the boundaries of performance and resilience, empowering developers to create groundbreaking applications on a reliable platform.  

We are looking to add new stunning colleagues to the teams outlined below.  

Team Spotlights  

Infra API
InfraAPI is Netflix's in-house IaaC solution - a resource federation platform built upon Kubernetes. We enable infra providers like compute, storage or networking to create end developer ""resources"" (aka primitives / abstractions) using a simple declarative language. This makes it possible to quickly ship experiences continuously raising the level of abstraction without needing to manually integrate with a number of delivery /mgmt platforms.  

Compute Runtime
Every engineer at Netflix works under the “build it, run it” model and our job is to make it safe, easy, and performant for them to run what they build. We own the host-level foundation for Netflix’s server fleet: the customized base operating system and core services that enable the secure and efficient operation of hosts across Netflix. We build core services that enable the provisioning and operation of large server fleets and own the data plane of our centrally managed container platform, Titus.**Must-have skills**
--------------------

* 7+ years of professional Software Engineering experience, preferably with recent technical leadership
* Recent and proficient experience with Java, C++, Go, Python, or similar
* Experience building & operating highly reliable distributed systems in a cloud environment
* Passion for technology, pragmatic thinking, ability to jump into an ambiguous area and break down complex problems
**What you'll be doing**
------------------------

* Building and operating Services, APIs, and Tooling for a variety of use-cases
* Balancing bias to action with the ability to make well-informed bets
* Engaging directly with end engineering users to understand their needs and improve their experience
* Understanding and solving business needs at scale with high-quality solutions
* Leaning into proactiveness and effective communication in pursuit of cross-functional alignment
**Success criteria**
--------------------

* You thrive in ambiguity; complex and fuzzy requirements are more common than clearly defined customer expectations
* You take incremental steps toward solving big problems; test and learn approaches work better than heads down development
* You are independent and self driven; progress is often self-directed by teams & individuals
* You’ve read about Netflix’s culture and think you would thrive here

Here are a few recent talks and posts from members of the team to highlight the work we do:  

Keeping Netflix Reliable Using Prioritized Load Shedding
How Netflix uses eBPF Flow logs
NATless IPv6/IPv4 Address Translation
Consistent caching mechanisms in Titus Gateway
Netflix Drive
