**Solutions Architect**

***(This position is hybrid and required to work 2 days a week in the Denton Texas Support Center)***


Our commitments are to build a truly diverse and inclusive company, care for our customers, people, and planet, and outperform together.

**Essential Function**


The solutions architect is accountable for proactively and holistically leading or supporting EA activities for creating deliverables that guide the developing direction for managing a portfolio of solutions in response to disruptive forces, and driving achieving targeted business outcomes. Solutions include systems (including applications, technologies, processes and information), shared infrastructure services and shared application services.


Solutions architects provide the necessary leadership, analysis and design tasks related to the development of an enterprise's solutions architecture. This individual creates deliverables that help develop a direction for managing the organization's portfolio of ""to be"" and ""as is"" solutions — including systems (meaning not just applications, but also processes and information), shared infrastructure services, and shared application services and components to better match targeted business outcome objectives. Solutions architecture is sometimes used interchangeably with applications and infrastructure architecture. However, both aforementioned typically fall under the purview of the solutions architect.


Application architecture is a subset of solutions architecture. It's the discipline that guides application design and defines application architecture paradigms, such as service-oriented architecture (SOA), principles that influence design decisions and patterns that provide proven design solutions.


Solutions architects leverage and use technology solutions to enable the organization's future-state business capabilities that, in turn, drive the organization's targeted outcomes. They facilitate and orchestrate the delivery of targeted business outcomes.

**Primary Duties**

* Understand business drivers and business capabilities (future and current state), and determine corresponding enterprise system designs and change requirements to drive the organization's targeted business outcomes.
* Design and lead the implementation of a solutions architecture across a group of specific business applications or technologies based on enterprise business strategy, business capabilities and business requirements.
* Manage and develop the architecture for a broader scope of projects, working closely with application architects that manage and design architecture for a single project or initiative.
* Provide consulting support to application architects within projects to ensure the project is aligned with the overall enterprise architecture.
* Monitor the current-state solution portfolio to identify deficiencies through aging of the technologies used by the application, or misalignment with business requirements.
* Understand technology trends and the practical application of existing, new, and emerging technologies to enable new and evolving business and operating models.
* Understand, advocate and augment the principles of information technology strategies.
* Analyze the business-IT environment (run, grow and transform the business) to detect critical deficiencies, and recommend solutions for improvement (systems of record, differentiation and innovation).
* Analyze the technology industry, competitors and market trends, and determine their potential impact on the enterprise.
* Define the principles, guidelines, standards and solution patterns to ensure solution decisions are aligned with the enterprise's future-state architecture vision.
* Design and direct the governance activities associated with ensuring solutions architecture assurance and compliance.
* Develop a roadmap for the evolution of the enterprise application portfolio from future to current state (as defined by the solutions architecture).
* Facilitate the evaluation and selection of software product standards and services, as well as the design of standard and custom software configurations.
* Consult with application and infrastructure development projects to fit systems or infrastructure to architecture and identify when it is necessary to modify projects to accommodate the solutions architecture.
* Identify the organizational impact (for example, on skills, processes, structures or culture) and financial impact of the solutions architecture.
* Document all solution architecture design and analysis work.
* Work closely with the program management office (PMO) or project management office to ensure the execution of plans corresponds with what is being promised.

**Credentials and Experience**

* Bachelor's degree in computer science, system analysis or a related study, or equivalent experience
* Minimum of five years of experience in at least two IT solution development disciplines, including technical architecture, network management, application development, middleware, database management or operations
* Exposure to multiple, diverse technologies and processing environments
* Good understanding of strategic and new and emerging technology trends, and the practical application of existing, new and emerging technologies to new and evolving business and operating models
* Understanding of agile methods and processes, and capability of supporting agile project teams by providing advice and guidance on opportunities, impact and risks, taking account of technical and architectural debt

**Skills**

* Exceptional interpersonal skills, including teamwork, facilitation and negotiation
* Strong leadership skills
* Excellent analytical and technical skills
* Excellent written and verbal communication skills
* Excellent planning and organizational skills
* Knowledge of all components of an enterprise technical architecture
* Knowledge of financial models and budgeting
* Excellent understanding of application development methodologies and infrastructure and network architecture
* Ability to work with developers in an in-and-out outsourced environment

**Competencies**

* Organizationally savvy, with a good understanding of the enterprise's political climate and how to navigate, influence and persuade political waters
* Ability to communicate, influence and persuade peers
* Ability to understand the long-term (""big picture"") and short-term perspectives of situations
* Ability to translate future-state business capabilities and requirements into solution architecture requirements
* Ability to propose and estimate the financial impact of solution architecture alternatives
* Ability to apply multiple technical solutions to business problems
* Ability to quickly comprehend the functions and capabilities of new technologies
* Proven ability to work well with others

**Characteristics**

* A respected leader
* Technology neutral: remains unbiased toward any specific technology or vendor choice, and is more interested in results than personal preferences
* Displays intellectual curiosity and integrity
* Motivated and driven by achieving long-term business outcomes

**Benefits**


We offer a competitive salary and outstanding benefits package that includes medical, dental, vision, life Insurance, paid vacation and sick days, paid holidays, tuition reimbursement and 401(k) with company match. In addition, associates of SBH may take advantage of our in house salon with complementary services and a varied selection of food options at our corporate campus.

------------


Constellaition is looking for a **Solution Architect**to join our **Anaplan** team in the **US**.

  

In this role, you will serve as the solution lead on our project team. Your role will be a highly client-facing one that involves eliciting robust requirements from clients, formulating that into a coherent design, leading a team to configure the solution, and working to deploy those solutions to a happy client. Depending on the size of the engagements, you may be placed on up to two projects simultaneously and will be charged with time management accordingly. You will be provided with training on core competencies in Constellaition's agile ASTRAL Methodology. It is expected that you are or will soon be a Certified Master Anaplanner. In addition to your project leadership responsibilities, you will also serve in a mentoring and management role to more junior consultants outside of your project team.


A superior enterprise-class planning and modeling platform, **Anaplan** provides the power, flexibility, security, and trustworthiness to solve challenging enterprise problems. Constellaition highly recommends Anaplan as an integral part of any large organization's technology stack.


At Constellaition, we expect our consultants to be well-rounded from a technical, functional, consultative, and collaborative perspective. At this point in your career, and looking at your career trajectory one and two levels up, you are a relatively new manager and leader and will focus on finding the authentic leadership traits within yourself. On this more *solution architecture-focused* path, success in this role involves being able to successfully lead projects from kickoff to deployment, continuing to draw on your experiences to claim concentrated expertise, leading innovations and refinement of how we conduct our business, elevating your communication skills to include senior management stakeholders, participating in demos/proofs-of-concept/business development in an assistive / subject-matter-expert capacity, helping to develop your direct reports, and perfecting your communication & collaboration skills with clients & team members. Generally, we would expect you to be able to lead smaller engagements without much assistance, whereas more Executive leadership will be present for more larger, more challenging Enterprise Transformation engagements.


We'll now begin to train you up on higher-order management and business development concepts, but as always we love candidates who exhibit higher-order thinking/creativity/problem-solving skills by being able to ""figure it out"" without having to be guided every step of the way.


**Role & Responsibilities**
---------------------------


* Lead team in delivery of Anaplan solution implementations leveraging the ASTRAL methodology
* Lead facilitation of client-facing meetings, instructing project manager & model builder(s) to update deliverables in the background
* Proactively collaborate on project management deliverables for Project Manager / Business Analyst
* Lead team in completion of delivery assets through Discovery & Design, Implementation, Testing, and Training & Deployment phases.
* Guide and lead model building team in translation of user stories into configured Anaplan solution
* Set expectations and sign off on model building standards, performance, and solution quality
* Collaborate with client team members to clarify translation of user stories into configured solution
* Lead team in performing and documenting unit testing to identify solution issues & bugs
* Lead team in preparation of and client execution of User Acceptance Testing scripts
* Lead team in preparation and delivery of End-User Adoption training materials & sessions
* Lead team in preparation and delivery of Solution Upkeep training materials & sessions
* Identification, contribution, and execution of initiatives to make it easier for those who come after you
* Completion of directed training curriculum
* Active participation in company events & culture activities
* Mentor junior team member(s) in development of their skills and advancement in their careers
