Culture is the single most important element of a company that is also bound to the operations and deliverables to the customers. If operations are a mess, so will be the culture.

• CANI – Constant And Never-ending Improvement. We work every day to be better than the day before.  

• 212° - “At 211 degrees, water is hot. At 212 degrees, it boils. And with boiling water, comes steam. And with steam, you can power a train.” This translates for us to be your very best. The extra degree can be applied to your entire life. What does adding an extra degree of effort to your relationships, your family, your job, etc. do? If you will just add an extra degree each and every time, you will soar in life.  

• I work harder on myself than I do my job. If you are working harder on your job than you do your life, you have the cart before the horse. Family first here at IT Authorities and we not only encourage personal development, we teach it too!

----------------


For companies building financial technology and transforming the financial services space, the biggest bottleneck to their growth and innovation is often the underlying banks and infrastructure stack they rely on. We have spent our careers founding and scaling companies like Plaid, Square, SoFi, Blend, and Affirm, and have seen this problem firsthand — builders and developers needing to partner with traditional banks, and creating API and abstraction layers over the patchwork that is the bank, its core, and many other vendors. All of this results in a complex (and often expensive) banking supply chain involving a user, fintech, BaaS middleware provider, bank, core and the Federal Reserve.

  

At Column, we set out to simplify and fix this. We are a bank and a software company built from the ground up, offering builders and developers technology-forward banking solutions that cut out the hundreds of vendors, middleware providers, and abstraction layers. This means a safer, more transparent, and less costly banking supply chain. Come build with us!

**The opportunity:**
--------------------


Column's Compliance team plays a critical role in ensuring that, as the Bank grows and expands its customer base, it does so in a way that is aligned with legal and regulatory standards in order to safeguard the interests of our customers. As part of this team, the Compliance Analyst will be responsible for helping deliver a best-in-class Compliance program, utilizing the Bank's technological capabilities to design innovative approaches to monitor and execute against regulatory expectations.


This role will be responsible for managing and executing Column’s Compliance Testing & Monitoring program, working with cross-functional partners throughout the Bank to ensure changes to compliance obligations are implemented appropriately, and supporting our Third Party Risk Management (TPRM) team to ensure compliance expectations are being met by the Bank’s Partners.


The role reports to the Bank’s Head of Regulatory Compliance. While an in-person position at the Bank’s San Francisco headquarters is strongly preferred, the role is open to remote applicants with the expectation of periodic travel.

**What you'll do:**
-------------------

* Manage and execute the Compliance Testing & Monitoring Program, which includes the execution of compliance testing across the Bank’s products and services
* Design, implement, and execute opportunities for Compliance Data Monitoring analysis to measure the Bank’s compliance obligations over full population data sets. You’ll be able to utilize the Bank’s core technology capabilities to help create and execute compliance monitoring to drive consistent measurement of compliance obligations on an ongoing basis
* Identify potential areas of weakness (inadequate/ineffective controls, areas of non-compliance, etc.) within the Bank and work with partners to strengthen the associated control environment
* Clearly document assessment findings, and own reporting of results derived from the Compliance Testing Program
* Identify, understand, and assess potential regulatory change events that may impact the Bank. Work with business, risk, and legal partners to ensure new regulatory requirements are clearly understood and processes are implemented prior to effective dates to adhere to new requirements

**What you'll need to be successful:**
--------------------------------------

* Bachelor’s degree or equivalent
* 5+ years of experience as a compliance or audit professional - experience at a financial institution is a plus
* Detail oriented with excellent interpersonal, written, and verbal communication skills
* Experience understanding how to navigate banking regulations and applying rules to the Bank’s products
* Demonstrated project management skills and the ability to juggle execution across multiple stakeholders
* Certified Regulatory Compliance Manager (CRCM), Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist (CAMS), or equivalent certification a plus.

**What you'll get from us:**

* FSA and HSA account options to enable use of pre-tax money for medical and dependent care expenses
* 401k plan, including self-directed brokerage options
* Flexible time-off policy - take the time off that you want and need to relax and recharge
* 100% paid parental leave, including 16 weeks for birth mothers, 12 weeks for primary caregivers, and 8 weeks for secondary caregivers
* Catered lunches and dinners for SF employees
* Commuter benefits
* Regular team building events, including annual offsite

**Pay transparency:**
---------------------


The annual base salary range for this position is $85,000 - $130,000, exclusive of equity compensation and benefits.


The range provided may be inclusive of several career levels at Column, and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors including, but not limited to, the candidate’s skill sets, experience, licensure and certifications, location, and other business and organizational needs.

**We look forward to hearing from you**
