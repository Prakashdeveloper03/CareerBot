**THE COMPANY**



B-Stock is the world's largest B2B recommerce marketplace for excess [or surplus] merchandise. Businesses of all sizes leverage the B-Stock platform to sell and buy customer returns, overstock and other excess merchandise - ranging from top brands and retailers who want best-in-class inventory management to entrepreneurs looking to source valuable merchandise for their resale businesses.



Tens of thousands of small business owners all over the globe use B-Stock to launch and power their resale business. We take pride in empowering these innovators and entrepreneurs of commerce.



In 2020 we sold 120 million items across our platform, giving a second life to this otherwise would be ""waste"" merchandise. In fact, we kept 400 million pounds of goods in use and saved millions from the landfill. It feels good to be B-Stock!



The amount of returned or unsold inventory continues to grow each year, and in 2020, it was estimated at over $1 trillion worth worldwide. We know there is tremendous value in and demand for this inventory - no matter the category, condition, or location. The B-Stock platform gives buyers a simple way to buy brand-name merchandise directly from top retailers and manufacturers. At the same time, we offer companies an automated, trusted replacement for traditional liquidation while boosting operational efficiency, recovery rates, and cycle time.



Led by eBay veterans and backed by top investors including Spectrum Equity, True Ventures, and Susquehanna Growth Equity, B-Stock shows no signs of slowing down. Our core values have shaped the company we are today and will continue to drive our success for many years to come.

**OUR VALUES**  

  

***Make Each Dollar Count***  

Whether it's the recovery amount or a buyer's budget, money matters to all of our clients. And because each dollar matters to them, it matters to us.


***Take Our Work Seriously, Not Ourselves***  

Everything at B-Stock continues to grow - everything but our egos, that is. We're not afraid to let loose and laugh (often at ourselves).


***Do The Hard Things Today That Will Pay Off Tomorrow***  

We're willing to sacrifice and endure, fail and adapt to reach our long-term goals.


***Use Trust As The Best Measure Of Success***  

The trust we earn along the way is more valuable than money. Without trust from both our buyers and sellers, our business won't succeed.


***Find Strength In Numbers***  

Use our passion for data to provide value to our customers, improve ourselves, and develop new ways to delight our buyers and sellers.  

  

*No applicant will face discrimination/harassment based on race, color, ancestry, national origin, religion, age, gender, marital domestic partner status, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability status, or veteran status.

Whether blatant or hidden, barriers to success have no place at B-Stock.*
