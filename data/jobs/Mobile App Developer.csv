**Who are we??**



Live streaming is a great medium for storytelling – and telling great stories benefits everyone. Whether you’re a creator, content marketer, entrepreneur, or just someone with something to say, live streaming is an exciting and effective way to spread your message. But live streaming tools are very complicated. You shouldn’t need to spend thousands of dollars on a computer or learn about encoding, just to start live streaming. The world misses out on so many great creators because of these barriers. Dan and Geige thought there should be a streaming tool that anyone could use – a tool that was fun instead of stressful – a tool that was simple, but powerful enough to create engaging content. We wanted people who weren’t techy, or who simply didn’t want to deal with the hassle of streaming, to still go live, share their stories, and grow their own communities.



Geige and Dan built StreamYard with three things in mind and continue to focus on these pillars today. The three StreamYard pillars include



* ease of use


* stability, and


* professional streams



StreamYard is built on those pillars. Our users tell us that StreamYard makes streaming fun – you can quickly create engaging content with guests, show on screen comments/lower thirds, and brand your broadcasts with themes, overlays, and backgrounds. You don’t need to know anything about technology or streaming to get started. And even though StreamYard is simple, techy folks love how powerful it is under the hood, and how effective it is for streaming group discussions.



We love StreamYard and its community. We work tirelessly to improve our tool and create the best experience possible.


**The Role**



StreamYard is seeking a contractor with expertise in video and audio capture on Android to to join our mobile team for a really exciting six month contract.

+ Uploading video content while the app is running and also in the background.

* Diagnose and fix bugs and performance bottlenecks
* Get your hands dirty with the WebRTC source code, if necessary.
* Maintain code and write automated tests to ensure the product is of the highest quality.
* Support the team using React Native to integrate with the new SDK.


**About You**


* Experienced Senior or Staff Android Engineer with extensive knowledge and experience in building and deploying Android applications

Gramercy Consultants, LLC (“Gramercy Tech”) is an award winning digital agency that was born out of the need to bring digital experiences to live events. We specialize in everything from concept creation, design, and software development to event management, credentialing and access control. Our team members are passionate about innovation, collaboration, and supporting one another. We are constantly striving to improve our platform and ourselves so that we can better support our clients.

Gramercy Tech is proud to be recognized by Clutch in their 2019 report as one of the top UX designers in New York and by Manifest as one of the top 25 IT services companies in New York. Additionally, we secured a spot on the Leader’s Matrix as a proven market leader and the top 8th UX consulting firm in New York City.

Our team is looking for a **Freelance Front End Developer** with extensive CSS and Javascript/jQuery experience that can help us manage and create content within our proprietary event CMS / platform, Eventfinity. The ideal candidate is passionate about design / UI / UX, is quick on their feet, has experience customizing content from top to bottom - especially within third party environments (think Squarespace, Weebly, Shopify, etc), and enjoys working in a fast paced environment.

This is not a traditional front end role -- the majority of work will be manipulating content in an existing structure/template, and implementing creative solutions utilizing Javascript/jQuery and CSS to accommodate client requests for customization. Experience working with a legacy codebase and existing within the confines of that environment is helpful.

The Eventfinity platform powers hybrid virtual events (e.g. agendas, video content, attendee directories, networking, chat rooms), as well as badge printing and mobile apps for in-person events. Front end developer responsibilities include working with project managers, clients, and the design team to bring events to life on the front end by editing plug-ins and client facing app code, strategizing around ways to use existing functionality to achieve client requests, or writing custom CSS and JS/jQuery to manipulate the current CMS functionalities and customize platform functionality. Candidates should have an eye for design and be well versed in JS / jQuery, CSS, and HTML.

Although the main focus of this role is almost entirely on the front-end side, there is always the possibility of growth; so knowledge of Vue, PHP, and Laravel is considered an important plus in order to facilitate communication between the front-end team and the back-end programmers who manage the development of the Eventfinity platform.

**Qualifications:**

* 2 or more years experience showing proficiency with front-end technologies, including HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and jQuery
* Experience building websites / microsites without relying on external frameworks is a huge plus, as you will be writing your own CSS / JS / HTML from scratch
* Familiarity with Ajax and asynchronous / dynamic content
* Experience creating complex mobile-first, responsive websites / microsites
* Solid understanding of cross browser/device responsive development
* Background in design / having a good eye for design, ability to pick up where mockups leave off
* Ability to manipulate the DOM while working within the confines of a CMS (Squarespace, Shopify, Weebly, etc)
* Experience utilizing Bootstrap framework
* Experience theming content within an existing platform; able to build a theme from the ground up, able to skin or build out a simple plugin, able to use a code editor to build complex JS/jQuery that will work within the platform, able to create readable and concise CSS
* Good understanding of ADA/WCAG compliance for an accessible web
* Experience debugging in the browser
* Understanding semantic structure and best JS / CSS practices to maintain optimization (understanding of caching/minification, image optimization, etc.)
* Strong communication / interpersonal skills, able to form productive working relationships while working remotely
* Ability to manage time and expectations while juggling multiple projects with different teams
* Excels under pressure and working with hard deadlines

**Job Type:** Temporary

*Salary based on skills and experience*

**Salary range:** $$20-$35 per hour

*Gramercy Consultants, LLC is committed to providing equal employment opportunities to all employees and applicants without regard to race, religion or religious creed, color, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical condition), genetic information, gender, gender identity and gender expression, sexual orientation, national origin, ancestry, citizenship status, marital status, uniform service member status, military and veteran status, tribal status, age, physical or mental disability, or any other protected status in accordance with applicable federal, state, and local laws.*

The Hopper platform serves hundreds of millions of travelers globally and continues to capture market share around the world. Ranked the third largest online travel agency in North America, the Hopper app has been downloaded over 120 million times and has become largely popular among younger travelers – with 70% of its users being Gen Z and millennials.  

While everyone knows us as the Gen Z and Millennial travel app, Hopper has evolved to become much more than that. In recent years, we’ve grown into a global travel agency and travel fintech provider that powers some of the world’s largest brands.

Almost 30% of our app customers purchase at least one fintech product when making a booking; and consumers are 1.6x more likely to repurchase if they add fintech to their booking vs if they booked just travel.  

Given the success of its fintech products, Hopper launched a B2B initiative, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions), which represents more than 50% of the business.  

 Through HTS, any travel provider (airlines, hotels, banks, travel agencies, etc.) can integrate and seamlessly distribute Hopper’s fintech or travel inventory on their direct channels.

==========================================

**About Peggy**
---------------


Peggy is the secure marketplace for investment-grade art. The company was founded by serial entrepreneurs Craig Follett and Adam Meghji, who have worked together for over a decade, and sold their last business to Live Nation Entertainment.


In times of societal crisis and turmoil throughout humanity, artists pave the way for social change and transformation. As an investment, art is among the only appreciating asset classes you can also enjoy (like real estate), plus is uncorrelated to traditional markets. This is why billionaires and banks seek out art as a safe haven to preserve wealth in their portfolios. Yet tragically, the rest of us are unable to participate in the art market, and support the practice of emerging artists who create transformative messages through their works.


Peggy partners with galleries and artists, to make living with and investing in art accessible to all. Finally you can buy incredible art at a price you can afford, and can later sell to fellow collectors if your tastes change or you seek to rebalance your art investments. Core to our values, Peggy does good by the artists themselves, who can finally earn artist royalties for all future secondary sales as well - something they miss out on today. This is all made possible using sophisticated and proprietary AI and ML which keeps buyers and sellers protected without the need for the antiquated and opaque Auction House model.

**About the Role**
------------------


Peggy is looking for a talented Flutter developer to work on our mobile-first frontend app. You will be partnering with our design, backend, and technical leadership teams as we drive towards our exciting alpha release.


Our world-class design team extensively uses Figma to create hi-fi mobile interfaces. You are responsible for providing initial developer feedback to them directly and iterating in Figma, before building the interfaces in Flutter. The backend team will provide you with an elegant and well-documented GraphQL API as an entry-point into Peggy's content, data, and business logic, and can incorporate your feedback as the API's first consumer.


Peggy's CTO, who will be involved in reviewing, testing, and providing feedback on your work. As a leader who believes in mentorship, guidance, and coaching, Peggy's CTO will also be involved in helping you hit the company goals you can directly impact, as well as encouraging your continued growth and happiness at all stages of your career.
