*\\*an 11-week minimum commitment is required \\**

**Location Details/Description:** Remote, Land Resources Division


For more information about the Land Resources Division, please visit https://www.nps.gov/orgs/1860/index.htm

**Position Overview:** The Land Resources Division guides and supports the land acquisition program for the National Park Service (NPS). Since its inception in 1916, the NPS has served as the ultimate caretaker of America's most valuable natural and cultural resources, while providing for public use and enjoyment of those resources. Today, the National Park System totals more than 84 million acres, yet more than 2.6 million acres of privately owned lands remain within NPS boundaries. Acquisition of all privately owned land within a given park boundary is not always necessary and, in some cases, not feasible. However, many of these lands are important for visitor use and preservation of resources and have therefore been identified to be protected in fee or by scenic/conservation easement interest.


The GIS Member(s) will assist the National Capital Region (NCR) in developing, for National Capital Parks, U.S. Reservation 405 (and potentially additional U.S. Reservations, if time and interest allows) a comprehensive geodatabase, including feature classes and land record attachments, that will provide NCR with a user-friendly record of the numerous historic realty transactions impacting the reservation. The work will entail: 1) research among NCR's digital records, DC Recorder of Deeds and DC Surveyor's Office databases, and possibly databases accessible online through the DOI Library; 2) retrieval of recorded instruments and plats that are either not currently on file with the NCR Lands Office or are not on file in complete or legible form; 3) analysis of the retrieved and assembled records; 4) digital mapping of approximately 320 historic transactions impacting the reservation; and 5) development of the geodatabase, to include record attachments, and feature classes, including those pertaining to DC's square, lot, and parcel system.

Geothermal energy is the most abundant renewable energy source in the world. There is 2,300 times more energy in geothermal heat in the ground than in oil, gas, coal, and methane combined. However, historically it’s been hard to find and expensive to develop. At Zanskar, we’re using better technology to find and develop new geothermal resources in order to make geothermal a cheap and vital contributor to a carbon-free electrical grid.  

The research team at Zanskar is at the cutting edge of developing tools to pinpoint and characterize geothermal resources with higher precision than ever before. To achieve this capability, we rely on data and we need to collect as much of it as possible. This data acquisition position is crucial for our task of advancing geothermal development technology to the next level and enabling Zanskar to achieve its mission.  

  

**Outcomes - Problems you’ll solve**
We need someone with a geological background to hunt through the literature and online resources both nationally and internationally to collect data we are interested in. Success looks like adding multiple and varied geophysical datasets into our databases that improve our AI and model performance. While we have several identified datasets, the role will also include identifying new relevant datasets that we can use. The Specialist’s day-to-day includes:* Identifying new data from journals, publications, and other sources
* Digitizing tables, plots, and images, and QC’ing data
* Innovating the tools and processes of finding and digitizing data
* Inserting data into structured formats in our infrastructure

 **Competencies – What we’re looking for*** **Familiarity with geoscience:** the candidate should be familiar with typical geological and geophysical data types and the process of creating geological models. This position is ideal for a candidate who has recently completed or is completing a Masters in geophysics, geology, environmental studies, GIS, or reservoir/petroleum engineering. Experience in using common GIS tools such as ArcGIS or QGIS is important.
* **Full-stack work ownership:** A stand-out specialist requires both the ability for novel, creative thinking about where and how to acquire data as well as the ability to deal with the tedium of reliable, detailed-oriented digitization where quality assurance is key. The Head of R&D should be able to provide general guidance and receive reliable data at a rapid clip.
* **Navigating research papers:** the candidate should know how to search for papers on Google Scholar and be familiar with the general structure of research papers for quickly finding relevant data.
* **Programming/technical**: the work may necessitate some light programming in Python or SQL. Some basic programming competence is preferred. A good candidate is interested in searching for and learning how to use new digitizing and search tools that are helpful in the data acquisition process.

**Location, Salary, and Benefits*** The initial contract position will be remote up to full-time for six months. Those located in SLC have the potential of follow-on work / advancement in the company.
* Pay dependent on location & experience; benchmarked $27-37/hr for US-based specialist
* A direct impact in displacing carbon emissions, and growth opportunities in a growing startup environment

The organization serves the Church worldwide to promote the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. **Samaritan's Purse Statement of Faith:*** We believe the Bible to be the inspired, the only infallible, authoritative Word of God. (1 Thessalonians 2:13; 2 Timothy 3:15-17)
* We believe that there is one God, eternally existent in three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. (Matthew 28:19; John 10:30; Ephesians 4:4-6)
* We believe in the deity of the Lord Jesus Christ, in His virgin birth, in His sinless life, in His miracles, in His vicarious and atoning death through His shed blood on the cross, in His bodily resurrection, in His ascension to the right hand of the Father, and in His personal return in power and glory. (Matthew 1:23; John 1:1-4 and 1:29; Acts 1:11 and 2:22-24; Romans 8:34; 1 Corinthians 15:3-4; 2 Corinthians 5:21; Philippians 2:5-11; Hebrews 1:1-4 and 4:15)
* We believe that all men everywhere are lost and face the judgment of God, that Jesus Christ is the only way of salvation, and that for the salvation of lost and sinful man, repentance of sin and faith in Jesus Christ results in regeneration by the Holy Spirit. (Luke 24:46-47; John 14:6; Acts 4:12; Romans 3:23; 2 Corinthians 5:10-11; Ephesians 1:7 and 2:8-9; Titus 3:4-7)
* We believe in the present ministry of the Holy Spirit, whose indwelling enables the Christian to live a godly life. (John 3:5-8; Acts 1:8 and 4:31; Romans 8:9; 1 Corinthians 2:14; Galatians 5:16-18; Ephesians 6:12; Colossians 2:6-10)
* We believe in the resurrection of both the saved and the lost; the saved unto the resurrection of eternal life and the lost unto the resurrection of damnation and eternal punishment. (1 Corinthians 15:51-57; Revelation 20:11-15)
* We believe in the spiritual unity of believers in the Lord Jesus Christ and that all true believers are members of His body, the church. (1 Corinthians 12:12, 27; Ephesians 1:22-23)
* We believe that the ministry of evangelism and discipleship is a responsibility of all followers of Jesus Christ. (Matthew 28:18-20; Acts 1:8; Romans 10:9-15; 1 Peter 3:15)
* We believe Gods plan for human sexuality is to be expressed only within the context of marriage, that God created man and woman as unique biological persons made to complete each other. God instituted monogamous marriage between male and female as the foundation of the family and the basic structure of human society. For this reason, we believe that marriage is exclusively the union of one genetic male and one genetic female. (Genesis 2:24; Matthew 19:5-6; Mark 10:6-9; Romans 1:26-27; 1 Corinthians 6:9)
* We believe that we must dedicate ourselves to prayer, to the service of our Lord, to His authority over our lives, and to the ministry of evangelism. (Matthew 9:35-38; 22:37-39, and 28:18-20; Acts 1:8; Romans 10:9-15 and 12:20-21; Galatians 6:10; Colossians 2:6-10; 1 Peter 3:15)
* We believe that human life is sacred from conception to its natural end; and that we must have concern for the physical and spiritual needs of our fellowmen. (Psalm 139:13; Isaiah 49:1; Jeremiah 1:5; Matthew 22:37-39; Romans 12:20-21; Galatians 6:10)"
