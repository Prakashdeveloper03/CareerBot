### **About Us**


Since 1945, U-Haul has been serving do-it-yourself movers and their households. Like many other successful ventures, the concept for U-Haul was generated out of need. After World War II, there existed the widespread need for do-it-yourself moving equipment that would be available on a one-way, nationwide basis.


U-Haul co-founders L.S. ""Sam"" Shoen and his wife, Anna Mary Carty Shoen, recognized that need and acted upon it. Their visionary approach spread the cost of ownership among many users, facilitating the mobility of the populations of the U.S. and Canada. The covered wagon of the pioneers morphed into orange U-Haul trailers. In the process, an industry was born.


U-Haul Holding Company and its family of companies, including U-Haul, have strived to create a culture of health and wellness. As of February 1, 2020, and consistent with applicable law, no U-Haul Holding Company or its family of companies will hire individuals in states where it may lawfully decline to hire individuals who use nicotine products (Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia and Washington). This policy will not apply to team members hired before February 1, 2020."

Job Description
As Project Coordinator on the Instructional Design and Development team at Chegg Skills, you will play a crucial tactical role supporting the team’s ever-growing pipeline of programs and ensuring we’re delivering on our project commitments. You will be a key contributor to the Content Ops team within the broader ID&D team, working as the team’s primary boots-on-the-ground liaison. You’ll work deep in the weeds of each project, ensuring that tasks, tickets, and deliverables are being completed and passed off, communicating updates to relevant stakeholders within the team, and keeping everyone on track to meet both incremental and overarching milestones.
This role requires a tricky balance – you must be comfortable being a deadline-driven task master while creating and sustaining a deep trust within the team. You must be able to work confidently in a highly visible role in an async/remote capacity – in other words, you must be able to track people down in order to push the work forward. And finally, you must be able to communicate clearly and effectively, particularly in writing. You will regularly compose clear, concise updates, ask relevant and targeted questions, and make specific requests in Jira, Slack, or elsewhere.
The Project Coordinator will be instrumental in helping us reach our content delivery goals. This will start as a 6-month contract with high likelihood of extension and conceivably future growth.

* Specific on-the-ground support for new program development, particularly for those programs that have clear and established workflows; may involve running or supporting regular meetings or syncs
* Monitoring explicit hand-offs of materials and tickets between team members and ensuring smooth and timely transitions between phases of development, particularly between instructional designers, SMEs, members of the Content Ops team, and editors/QA specialists/content producers
* Managing curriculum bug intake and triage process; audit and flag possible improvements this process to ensure we’re supporting cross-functional teams and students
* Supporting media production processes, including art log management, video pre-production timelines, and the hand-off of media artifacts
* Providing regular updates on new program development progress to project manager and other stakeholders
* Planning and setting up meetings, creating program documentation, and organizing project logistics
* Uploading Jira tickets, managing certain predictable or regular async comms across the team, and providing other project management support as it arises
* Support Content Operations team on process changes; identify pain points and problems inhibiting efficient or quality content production or maintenance
* As needed, collaborate with the Content Ops team and instructional designers understand and prioritize curriculum updates – helping determine the scope of changes, set realistic dates for curriculum release, and manage the completion of editorial, QA, and publishing tasks to meet deadlines


Requirements* 3+ years of experience in a project coordinator, project manager, or digital content production role (or adjacent or similar title/position).
* Familiarity with and comfort with project management software; nice-to-have: experience with Jira/Confluence specifically.
* A nice-to-have: experience working in curriculum design, edtech, education, tech bootcamp, or similar tech or tech-adjacent space.
* Ability to work independently, meet deadlines, and handle multiple projects simultaneously.
* Excellent communication and collaboration skills, particularly in writing.
* Exceptional time-management and organizational skills, and strong attention to detail.
* Ability to adapt to evolving industry standards and technologies.
* Flexible hours to accommodate varying workloads.

About Avalara:
**About Avalara:**  

We’re building cloud-based tax compliance solutions to handle every transaction in the world. Imagine every transaction you make — every tank of gas, cup of coffee, or pair of sneakers, every movie ticket, meal kit, or streamed song, every sensor-to-sensor ping. Nearly every time you make a purchase, physical or digital, there’s an accompanying unique and nuanced tax compliance calculation. The logic behind calculating taxes — the rules, rates, and boundaries is a global, layered, three-dimensional mess of complexity, with compliance dictated by governments and applied by every business, every day.  

Avalara works with businesses of all sizes, all over the world — from corner stores to gigantic global retailers — to calculate tax accurately and automatically, at speeds measured in milliseconds. That’s a massive technical challenge, in terms of scale, reliability, and complexity, and we do it better than anyone. That’s why we’re growing fast. Headquartered in Seattle, Avalara has offices across the U.S. and around the world, in Brazil, Canada, India, U.K, Belgium and across Europe. **Equal Opportunities:**
  

Avalara is an Equal Opportunity Employer. All qualified candidates will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, colour, creed, religion, age, gender, national orientation, disability, sexual orientation, US Veteran status, or any other factor protected by law."
