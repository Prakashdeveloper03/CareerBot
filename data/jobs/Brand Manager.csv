**Job Description**
-------------------



Our mission at ISRG is to reduce financial, technological, and educational barriers to secure communication over the Internet. We operate three projects (Let’s Encrypt, Prossimo, and Divvi Up) that improve the security and privacy of billions of people using the Internet.



ISRG celebrated its 10th anniversary in 2023. During that decade, revenues have steadily grown and diversified to respond to growing needs and ambitions within our organization. We are a small team of four (soon to be five!) so we focus on efficiency, automation, and going for the big wins (for example, the lowest tier in our corporate sponsorship program is $12,500 and the highest is $500,000+). We operate as a combined comms and fundraising team because we view the two functions as symbiotic. As such, we highly value and deliver strategic, compelling, and effective communications which are the wind in the sails of our successful fundraising.



We are looking for an experienced development professional to help strengthen and diversify our funding channels. This will primarily include:



* Expand and upgrade our corporate sponsorships


* Build our earned revenue pipeline


* Prospect, cultivate and solicit contributions from high-value individual donors



We are looking for someone who is a self-starter and seeks opportunities to expand or improve our work. That means you will have the opportunity to impact other aspects of our fundraising, including communications strategy, grant strategy and writing, and revenue development for funding new ISRG projects.


**Position Must-Haves**
-----------------------


* Track record of achieving non-profit fundraising revenue targets
* Track record of cultivating and closing 6+ figure gifts
* Ability to prioritize and manage multiple projects
* Creative thinking *and* the ability to create the systems and structure needed to make new ideas successful
* Excellent spoken and written communication skills
* Interest in technical aspects of our projects
* A mindset oriented toward efficiency and the elimination of daily “toil”
* Persistent and creative
* Openness to lend a hand to colleagues if that is the highest priority, regardless of whose responsibility it is
* Willing and able to travel


We are heavily funded by tech companies new and old. The decision-makers we work with are often a CTO, CIO or founder/CEO, so you will need to be confident in recognizing their needs, using appropriate communication styles, and developing messaging that is effective with this audience.


**Location and Benefits**
-------------------------



This is a remote position available anywhere in the contiguous United States. Travel expectations are 3-5 times per year. We will help you get your home office in good shape, including reimbursing internet and phone expenses. Other benefits include excellent health insurance, a 100% match for 401k contributions, flexible time off and generous parental leave.


**EEO Statement and Inclusive Workplace**
-----------------------------------------



Not sure if you actually meet some of our requirements? Studies have shown that female-identifying folks and people of color are less likely to be confident that they meet requirements. At ISRG we are dedicated to building a diverse, inclusive, and authentic workplace, so if you’re excited about this role but you’re not sure if your past experience aligns with the requirements in the job description, we encourage you to reach out to careers@abetterinternet.org.



ISRG is an Equal Opportunity Employer. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, gender, orientation, national origin, age, disability, or any other characteristic.

Vadilal, the iconic brand from the house of Vadilal Dairy International Limited, is one of India’s most beloved ice cream brands. Since its inception in 1907 as a family run handcrafted ice cream business, the company has evolved into an ISO 22000:2005 certified outfit. Beginning as a humble soda fountain under the patronage of Shri. Vadilal Gandhi in Ahmedabad, Vadilal slowly branched out into handcrafted ice creams. The business was then passed onto Vadilal’s son Ranchodlal, who oversaw the brand’s foray into the retail market. It was the third generation entrepreneur sons of Ranchodlal -Ramchandra and Lakshman – who took the brand to new heights. Their bold vision saw the company expand to 10 outlets in Ahmedabad by 1973. This was followed by new outlets in Gujarat’s other cities. By 1985, the company had expanded to the neighbouring states and provided stiff competition to global ice cream brands in India. It was in 1993 that Vadilal first delighted the taste buds of five new states in the form of Goa, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Kerala. This was due to the foresight of Shri Shailesh R. Gandhi, the second son of the late Shri Ramchandra Gandhi, who initiated his expansion plans by establishing Vadilal’s presence in Maharashtra’s other states. Like any other world-renowned food brand, Vadilal is driven by high quality standards, hygienic production facilities and a deep-rooted presence in urban and rural India. Having achieved

numerous milestones and awards over the years, the brand has progressed with great conviction and focus. That, combined with a team of dedicated employees, is what keeps Vadilal on course to provide customers with Nothing But Goodness.
