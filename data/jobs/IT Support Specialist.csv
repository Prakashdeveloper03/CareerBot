About Avalara:
**About Avalara:**  

We’re building cloud-based tax compliance solutions to handle every transaction in the world. Imagine every transaction you make — every tank of gas, cup of coffee, or pair of sneakers, every movie ticket, meal kit, or streamed song, every sensor-to-sensor ping. Nearly every time you make a purchase, physical or digital, there’s an accompanying unique and nuanced tax compliance calculation. The logic behind calculating taxes — the rules, rates, and boundaries is a global, layered, three-dimensional mess of complexity, with compliance dictated by governments and applied by every business, every day.  

Avalara works with businesses of all sizes, all over the world — from corner stores to gigantic global retailers — to calculate tax accurately and automatically, at speeds measured in milliseconds. That’s a massive technical challenge, in terms of scale, reliability, and complexity, and we do it better than anyone. That’s why we’re growing fast. Headquartered in Seattle, Avalara has offices across the U.S. and around the world, in Brazil, Canada, India, U.K, Belgium and across Europe. **Equal Opportunities:**
  

Avalara is an Equal Opportunity Employer. All qualified candidates will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, colour, creed, religion, age, gender, national orientation, disability, sexual orientation, US Veteran status, or any other factor protected by law."

**REPORTS TO:** VP of Science and Research & Director of Operations

**About the Family Heart Foundation**  
Imagine the stress of living in a family where your seemingly healthy relatives inexplicably suffered fatal or life-threatening heart attacks with few, if any, cardiac risk factors. Now imagine learning that it’s your family’s genetics that are putting you and your relatives at risk. And while genetics can’t be changed, they can be managed in ways that dramatically lower risk. The Family Heart Foundation is dedicated to saving generations of families from heart disease through timely diagnosis and improved care.

The Family Heart Foundation® launched the use of artificial intelligence, combined with implementation science to address the profound lack of screening and diagnosis for familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) a decade ago in our Flag, Identify, Network, and Deliver (FIND) Initiative. The machine learning model has been validated and published in *Lancet Digital Health* and *Nature Digital Medicine*. The Family Heart Foundation has partnered with 9 major health systems to date and is now on the cusp of launching FIND Lipoprotein(a) or Lp(a) with at least 6 health systems partners. Less than 1% of Americans are currently being screened for high Lp(a), although 20% of the population carries genetic mutations which put them at high risk for premature cardiovascular disease, including strokes and heart attacks.

**POSITION PURPOSE:**  
The Program Manager reports directly to the Family Heart Foundation VP of Science and Research and the Director of Operations. This role provides an unprecedented opportunity to make a difference in the lives of thousands of families from across the United States.

The results of this work will expand our knowledge and directly impact individuals with genetic dyslipidemias, their families, healthcare providers and policy makers from around the country about implementation of best practices for approaching genetic drivers of premature cardiac disease. This position will allow you to grow professionally and as a person, contributing to the greater good.

Health Care Without Harm (HCWH) is an international nongovernmental organization (NGO) that works to transform healthcare worldwide so that it reduces its environmental footprint, becomes a community anchor for sustainability, and a leader in the global movement for environmental health and justice. With regional offices on four continents, partners around the world, and global and regional initiatives, HCWH is leading the global sustainable healthcare movement.


Global Green and Healthy Hospitals (GGHH), a program of Health Care Without Harm, is an international network of hospitals, healthcare facilities, health systems, and health organizations dedicated to reducing their environmental footprint and promoting public and environmental health. GGHH has over 1,150 institutional members in Latin America, which represent the interests of over 27,600 hospitals and health centers in the region.


Requirements: **Contract description**


Health Care Without Harm is looking for a professional, detailed oriented, technical consultant to support the implementation of our regional climate program for Latin America, with a focus on policy work at the national level and agenda-setting in multilateral processes.


HCWH has a growing body of work aimed at facilitating the transition towards climate-smart healthcare worldwide. A key part of this work is collaborating with governments at different levels to promote a health-in-all-policies approach, particularly to make sure that the climate-health nexus is comprehensively addressed in normative and policy frameworks. In 2021, HCWH published the Global Road Map for Health Care Decarbonization, which charts the path towards zero emissions healthcare by 2050, and launched the Operation Zero project to develop a methodology for governments to establish their own decarbonization roadmaps. That same year, as the leading international organization working on mitigation in this sector, HCWH became the official partner for the health component of the UN Race to Zero campaign, and joined the government of the United Kingdom and the World Health Organization (WHO) in a partnership that launched the COP26 Health Programme. The latter called on national governments to commit to the development of climate resilient, sustainable and low carbon health systems; 82 countries have adopted these commitments so far, including 12 Latin American nations (Argentina, Bahamas, Belize, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Jamaica, Panama, and Peru). In 2022, WHO launched the Alliance on Transformative Action on Climate and Health (ATACH) to support these countries’ implementation efforts, establishing five working groups (HCWH co-chairs the one on Low Carbon and Sustainable Health Systems).


Global action to advance the climate and health agenda has since surged. Among other key milestones, the 2022 G7 Health Ministers’ Communiqué included a commitment to secure “climate-neutral health systems at the latest by 2050 and to support other countries in this effort”; the 2023 G20 Health Ministers Meeting resulted in a commitment to prioritize “climate-resilient health systems development, building sustainable and low-carbon/low greenhouse gas (GHG) emission health systems and healthcare supply” and the launch of a Climate and Health Initiative supported by the Asian Development Bank; and the 28th UN Climate Change Conference was the first ever to have a day dedicated to health, the proceedings of which included a Climate and Health Ministerial Meeting that adopted the COP28 Declaration on Climate and Health (signed by more than 140 countries so far).


Since 2019 HCWH has provided technical assistance to national and subnational governments in the Latin American region, with an emphasis on healthcare decarbonization. Recent collaborations have focused on emissions baselining using the Climate Impact Checkup tool, both at the facility (e.g. Peru) and at the system level (e.g. Colombia). In addition, the organization has supported regional and sub-regional efforts, such as providing training on estimating the carbon footprint of health systems and facilities to representatives of the six Andean ministries of health, in coordination with the Andean Health Organization.


The Latin America Team is now looking to expand its policy work with a two-folded strategy: supporting ATACH countries in the region in their implementation efforts, and leveraging the Brazilian Presidency of the G20 (2024) and of COP30 (2025) to provide a strong regional push for the advancement of the climate and health agenda. The technical consultant will support the LAC Team in delivering robust outcomes for both priority areas, including by: working with key stakeholders such as PAHO to develop approaches to national implementation and technical resources; following up on existing work with governments in the region, and exploring new collaborations; supporting policy drafting; leading agenda-setting efforts within various multilateral processes; and contributing to broader movement building by leveraging the climate leadership of health systems (particularly Race to Zero members) and strengthening health professionals’ climate advocacy.

**Consultancy goals and deliverables**

* Supporting HCWH’s LAC Team in the design of approaches, country programs and initiatives to facilitate the implementation of the COP26 Health Programme in Latin America, as well as a more active participation of the region in ATACH proceedings.
* Supporting the Climate Program Manager for Latin America in delivering the LAC Team’s contribution to the overall HCWH/PHS engagement strategy with Brazil, and promoting a strong Latin American voice on climate and health in international processes, including but not limited to the G20 and the UNFCCC COPs. Helping organize at least one event on the sidelines of this year’s G20 Health Working Group meetings in Brazil.
* Supporting the Climate Program Manager for Latin America in following up on existing or previous initiatives with countries in the region, particularly Argentina, Colombia and Peru, and exploring new collaborations with national and subnational governments around climate-smart healthcare, prioritizing ATACH members.
* Supporting the Climate Program Manager for Latin America in building partnerships with governments and other key stakeholders, including but not limited to the Pan American Health Organization.
* Contributing to internal discussions to support HCWH’s approach to working with national governments, including the potential participation of a LAC country in future phases of the Operation Zero project and other cross-regional collaborations.
* Developing strategies to mobilize health systems, health facilities and health professionals to build a strong regional movement that advocates for robust climate and health policies.
* Producing technical recommendations, policy briefs, concept notes, side-event proposals and other resources to advance the climate and health agenda in the region.
* Generally supporting the LAC Team’s policy and health professional engagement work, by preparing communications and materials for meetings and training sessions, organizing project documentation and databases, and overseeing the logistical and substantive preparation of key virtual and in-person events, among others.


The activities outlined above are expected to require a time commitment of 40 hours per week. Availability to participate in virtual meetings and coordination calls (scheduled in advance during working hours, Mexico time) is required. Deliverables and timings for the submission of deliverables may be updated upon written (email) agreement by both parties.


Coordination with HCWH throughout the project will take place remotely, but some of the activities might require in-person participation (agreed to in advance).
