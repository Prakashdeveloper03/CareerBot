The California Independent System Operator (ISO) manages the flow of electricity across the high-voltage, long-distance power lines that make up 80 percent of California's power grid. We safeguard the economy and well-being of 30 million Californians by operating the grid reliably 24/7.


As the impartial grid operator, the California ISO opens access to the wholesale power market that is designed to diversify resources and lower prices. It also grants equal access to 25,865 circuit-miles of power lines and reduces barriers to diverse resources competing to bring power to customers.


The California ISO's function is often compared to that of air traffic controllers. It would be grossly unfair for air traffic controllers to represent one airline and profit from allowing that company's planes to go through before others. In the same way, the California ISO operates independently—managing the electron traffic on a power grid we do not own—making sure electricity is safely delivered to utilities and consumers on time and reliably.

**The California ISO is committed to the health, safety, and work/life integration of its employees, and is proud to offer flexible work arrangements. This position would be eligible to participate in a remote work capacity, but requires the ability to commute in as needed.**

**Relocation assistance is available.**

 **Job Description**  

Under the general direction of the Manager of Transmission Assets, works on complex assignments and acts as technical expert to department staff, and provides expertise in support of Transmission Asset activities. Ensures the ISO is in compliance with the Transmission Control Agreement (TCA) and is responsible for the implementation and enforcement of the ISO Transmission Maintenance Standards with respect to transmission facility (stations and associated equipment) maintenance. Responsible for the administration of the Transmission Register, working with internal and external stakeholders to ensure the TR data is accurate. Supports the ISO planning process phase three competitive solicitation process.

**Your Work Would Consist Of:**

* Oversees the implementation and enforcement of the ISO Transmission Maintenance Standards. Conducts maintenance reviews of each PTO’s station maintenance records and facilities. Analyzes results from the annual maintenance reviews, standard maintenance reporting system, and availability measures to identify any positive or negative trending, and makes appropriate recommendations to the ISO and PTOs that will result in overall improvements to grid reliability.
* Provides the primary administrative functions for the Transmission Register (TR) for internal and external stakeholders.
* Provides station expertise and joint oversight in implementing the CAISO Transmission Planning Process Phase III competitive solicitation process.
* Partners with and supports the Regional Transmission Engineering, Grid Operations, and others within the ISO to understand and resolve identified transmission facility related issues. Trains and mentors others concerning transmission facilities and their function. Resolves transmission facility maintenance related stakeholder issues.
* In partnership with the Manager of Transmission Assets, guides and sets goals to improve the functionality of the group and the overall department. Actively participates in staff meetings, and identifies improvements to department practices, policies and processes. Represents the ISO’s interests in public and industry forums.
* Ensures that Transmission Assets remains in compliance with FERC, NERC and other regulatory requirements relating to transmission maintenance. Responsible for Transmission Assets transmission facility compliance reporting requirements.
* Leads the Transmission Maintenance Coordination Committee (TMCC) in the absence of the Director of Grid Assets.
* The position requires travel within the ISO’s footprint 5 to 7 times a year to inspect substation and high voltage equipment.

  

**Qualifications** **Level of Education and Discipline:**

* A Bachelor's degree (BA, BS) required in Engineering. Focus in electrical power systems preferred.

**Amount of Experience:**

* Equivalent years of education and training, plus five (5) or more years related experience.

At Pathrise we have a unique understanding of the hiring process from the perspective of companies and candidates, and the ups and downs that come with it. Candidates are close to our hearts - we've been them, we coach them, we know them.  

Our general full-time hiring process outlined below. ***Note: this doesn't apply to part-time roles which consist of an intro call + a 30-45 min final interview.*** **Application Stage*** Our recruiting team reviews applications and responds to qualified applicants as quickly as possible.
* Our ATS does not auto-reject in any way

* For other roles, this stage is a hands-on skill assessment that gives you a firsthand glimpse of what basic skills are needed to execute in this role, and how they'll be applied. It also gives us early signals on the more technical aspects of candidate fit.

 **Virtual Onsite (full-time roles only)*** Candidates will meet with hiring managers and collaborators for further skill assessments and behavioral interviews.


- Because this stage can take considerable time for all candidates and interviewers (1.5 - 3 hours), we are very intentional about how we conduct it and who we move forward. We do our best to be mindful of time commitments and candidate efforts, and will communicate if things change unexpectedly.* You'll receive guidance well in advance.
