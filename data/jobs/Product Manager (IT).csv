Happy vets make for happy pets.  

Roo is on a mission to create a world of increased opportunity, professional empowerment, and improved animal care for animal hospitals and veterinarian professionals. By connecting hospitals in need with professionals with a new groundbreaking platform, our goal is to optimize hospital talent staffing and improve quality of life for veterinarians, all while giving pets a chance to have access to safe, high-quality care.  

  

Over the next decade, Roo will unlock millions in economic opportunities, improve quality of life for tens of thousands of veterinarians, and facilitate millions of hours of pet care. We've been growing tremendously since launching in early 2019 and now seeing even more traction as we scale up fast. **What We Do**  

Roo (www.roo.vet) has created the first B2B labor marketplace in animal healthcare that connects veterinary professionals with hospitals through innovative technology, with opportunities to expand and offer more opportunities for both our demand & supply of users.  

Our dynamic platform enables hospitals to fulfill personnel needs in real time, while allowing high-quality veterinary professionals to secure work at the click of a button. Beyond the platform, Roo represents a growing opportunity to help hospitals meet all-things staffing, and a growing community of resilient vet industry professionals who value flexibility and work-life balance, in addition to providing the best possible outcomes for clients and their pets.  

Our aim is to combine experienced healthcare expertise with Silicon Valley talent to shake up this industry and change the way veterinarians and hospitals work! **About the Role**  

As a Sr. Product Manager at Roo, you will lead a cross functional team of engineers, designers, analysts, marketers and more in a quest to achieve a major company objective. You will craft the strategy, define the north-star metric, ensure the dashboarding to help guide your execution, and keep the company informed of progress through your written updates. Your north-star metric will directly tie to the “Roo Equation”, the equation that defines our business model, so you’ll always know you’re having an impact. You and your team will operate with significant autonomy as you take a growth-minded, iterative approach to learning, moving fast (almost uncomfortably so) and ultimately driving a measurable outcome by building levers for our customers and internal users.  

This role reports directly to the SVP of Product, Growth, & Design and while the role will operate on a remote basis, you will be required to occasionally be onsite in our San Francisco coworking space for meetings and team events.
### **Your Responsibilities**

+ Unite your team behind a strategy to tackle your initiative goals.
+ Ensure the measurability of the impact of your efforts.
+ Lead the product process and maintain a rolling roadmap with emphasis on always finding the best project to drive maximum impact toward your north star metric.
+ Devise creative product solutions to the core problems facing your team.
+ Track metrics impact of projects and develop insights that inform the rolling roadmap.
+ Ensure that the projects delivered are improvements to the user experience.
+ Write weekly updates to the executive team and key stakeholders summarizing your team’s impact, insights, and plans.

### **Qualifications**

+ **Marketplace experience.** You have 4+ years working on core, supply or demand teams of a growing marketplace product.
+ **Impact focus** and a consistent history of delivering measurable results for both users and the business.
+ **Strong writing skills**, especially in strategic communication.
+ **Verbal communication** that is clear and effective.
+ **Ability to think big and small** to build a portfolio of experiments and larger features. You are as comfortable white boarding a completely new experience as you are optimizing an existing flow and know when to do which.
+ **Data-informed**. You deeply understand how your products work and how to measure long-term impact. You know every step of the funnel. You can design, run, and interpret experiments and A/B tests, and probably know a bit of SQL
+ **Natural leadership.** You know how to influence people to get things done across any job function. People love working with you.
+ **Prioritize UX.** You think deeply about how the product fits into the life of the customer and can prototype solutions as a method of communicating your ideas for improvement.
+ **Understand startup velocity.** You easily adapt to shifting priorities, evolving strategies, and resource constraints, knowing that it’s a natural part of scaling a product at this stage.
