Our mission is to help people everywhere build their careers by being the world’s best career agency.

***Unfortunately, we cannot accept applicants who are currently on an H1B visa, as this is a 1099 role.*** **The Pathrise Approach to Hiring**  

At Pathrise we have a unique understanding of the hiring process from the perspective of companies and candidates, and the ups and downs that come with it. Candidates are close to our hearts - we've been them, we coach them, we know them.  

Our general full-time hiring process outlined below. ***Note: this doesn't apply to part-time roles which consist of an intro call + a 30-45 min final interview.*** **Application Stage*** Our recruiting team reviews applications and responds to qualified applicants as quickly as possible.
* Our ATS does not auto-reject in any way


- Note that some part-time roles are listed in ""Inactive - Resume Pool"" status, meaning hiring happens on a rolling basis and may open unexpectedly.  

  

**Intro Call*** In this 30 minute phone call, we aim to align on the role and answer your questions to ensure a mutual fit
* Taking the next step in your career is a big deal! Ask whatever questions you need to ensure we're the right fit for you.
* Candidates who advance will be provided with a helpful guide to support their candidate experience.

 **Skill Assessment or Hiring Manager Interview*** For some roles, this is a 30 minute Google Meet interview with a hiring manager.
* For other roles, this stage is a hands-on skill assessment that gives you a firsthand glimpse of what basic skills are needed to execute in this role, and how they'll be applied. It also gives us early signals on the more technical aspects of candidate fit.

 **Virtual Onsite (full-time roles only)*** Candidates will meet with hiring managers and collaborators for further skill assessments and behavioral interviews.


- Because this stage can take considerable time for all candidates and interviewers (1.5 - 3 hours), we are very intentional about how we conduct it and who we move forward. We do our best to be mindful of time commitments and candidate efforts, and will communicate if things change unexpectedly.* You'll receive guidance well in advance.

 **Reference Interviews (full-time roles only)*** We'll ask for some professional references to follow up with.
