What We’re Like


Global, Yet Tight-knit


We have a global team with offices in the UK, Singapore, and North America. Many of us work remote, but we stay close with weekly company calls, and a yearly global gathering in Brighton, UK. We’re a warm group that is built on mutual support, exchange, and respect, with a good dose of humor in the mix.  

Career Growth


We believe that one of the key ways we grow our business is by growing ourselves. We support a non-linear progression through the business which appreciates individual spikes rather than forcing seniority through client or business skills. We value that everyone has a unique “honeycomb” of skills that builds our collective expertise and influence.  

Contribution over Fit


We invite having singular, perceptive, and insightful people that don’t fit any typical moulds, and are able to really contribute to our work by enriching it.  

No Passengers


At Space Doctors, we are deeply passionate about thinking critically about culture, how it’s shifting, understanding what that means for brands and organizations, and working with our clients to embed that understanding in their initiatives. This is not work that comes easily, nor in isolation. With that, everyone works to the fullest of their ability and pitches in to assist others swiftly and thoughtfully. We hope that anyone that joins our team finds their time with us to be challenging, exciting, and hugely rewarding.  

  

**Anticipated Salary Range & Benefits**  

For this particular role, the range is $75,000 - $95,000 a year for full time (depending on experience and skill level). Space Doctors provides an excellent benefits package to our team with generous PTO.
