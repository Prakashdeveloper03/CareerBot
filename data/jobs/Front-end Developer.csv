Gramercy Consultants, LLC (“Gramercy Tech”) is an award winning digital agency that was born out of the need to bring digital experiences to live events. We specialize in everything from concept creation, design, and software development to event management, credentialing and access control. Our team members are passionate about innovation, collaboration, and supporting one another. We are constantly striving to improve our platform and ourselves so that we can better support our clients.

Gramercy Tech is proud to be recognized by Clutch in their 2019 report as one of the top UX designers in New York and by Manifest as one of the top 25 IT services companies in New York. Additionally, we secured a spot on the Leader’s Matrix as a proven market leader and the top 8th UX consulting firm in New York City.

Our team is looking for a **Freelance Front End Developer** with extensive CSS and Javascript/jQuery experience that can help us manage and create content within our proprietary event CMS / platform, Eventfinity. The ideal candidate is passionate about design / UI / UX, is quick on their feet, has experience customizing content from top to bottom - especially within third party environments (think Squarespace, Weebly, Shopify, etc), and enjoys working in a fast paced environment.

This is not a traditional front end role -- the majority of work will be manipulating content in an existing structure/template, and implementing creative solutions utilizing Javascript/jQuery and CSS to accommodate client requests for customization. Experience working with a legacy codebase and existing within the confines of that environment is helpful.

The Eventfinity platform powers hybrid virtual events (e.g. agendas, video content, attendee directories, networking, chat rooms), as well as badge printing and mobile apps for in-person events. Front end developer responsibilities include working with project managers, clients, and the design team to bring events to life on the front end by editing plug-ins and client facing app code, strategizing around ways to use existing functionality to achieve client requests, or writing custom CSS and JS/jQuery to manipulate the current CMS functionalities and customize platform functionality. Candidates should have an eye for design and be well versed in JS / jQuery, CSS, and HTML.

Although the main focus of this role is almost entirely on the front-end side, there is always the possibility of growth; so knowledge of Vue, PHP, and Laravel is considered an important plus in order to facilitate communication between the front-end team and the back-end programmers who manage the development of the Eventfinity platform.

**Qualifications:**

* 2 or more years experience showing proficiency with front-end technologies, including HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and jQuery
* Experience building websites / microsites without relying on external frameworks is a huge plus, as you will be writing your own CSS / JS / HTML from scratch
* Familiarity with Ajax and asynchronous / dynamic content
* Experience creating complex mobile-first, responsive websites / microsites
* Solid understanding of cross browser/device responsive development
* Background in design / having a good eye for design, ability to pick up where mockups leave off
* Ability to manipulate the DOM while working within the confines of a CMS (Squarespace, Shopify, Weebly, etc)
* Experience utilizing Bootstrap framework
* Experience theming content within an existing platform; able to build a theme from the ground up, able to skin or build out a simple plugin, able to use a code editor to build complex JS/jQuery that will work within the platform, able to create readable and concise CSS
* Good understanding of ADA/WCAG compliance for an accessible web
* Experience debugging in the browser
* Understanding semantic structure and best JS / CSS practices to maintain optimization (understanding of caching/minification, image optimization, etc.)
* Strong communication / interpersonal skills, able to form productive working relationships while working remotely
* Ability to manage time and expectations while juggling multiple projects with different teams
* Excels under pressure and working with hard deadlines

*Salary based on skills and experience*

### **About Us**


Since 1945, U-Haul has been serving do-it-yourself movers and their households. Like many other successful ventures, the concept for U-Haul was generated out of need. After World War II, there existed the widespread need for do-it-yourself moving equipment that would be available on a one-way, nationwide basis.


U-Haul co-founders L.S. ""Sam"" Shoen and his wife, Anna Mary Carty Shoen, recognized that need and acted upon it. Their visionary approach spread the cost of ownership among many users, facilitating the mobility of the populations of the U.S. and Canada. The covered wagon of the pioneers morphed into orange U-Haul trailers. In the process, an industry was born.


U-Haul Holding Company and its family of companies, including U-Haul, have strived to create a culture of health and wellness. As of February 1, 2020, and consistent with applicable law, no U-Haul Holding Company or its family of companies will hire individuals in states where it may lawfully decline to hire individuals who use nicotine products (Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia and Washington). This policy will not apply to team members hired before February 1, 2020."

In essence, we use data science to marry patents, financial, and market data, in order to answer fundamental questions related to patent and innovation strategy. Right now, our SaaS and DaaS solutions serve corporate IP departments and the defense sector. We plan to expand to financial institutions with a new 2.0 version of our SaaS platform.

Here’s the exciting news: we are building that new 2.0 SaaS platform with a brand new front end, new back end system, and sophisticated data science models that use a confluence of data from various data sources (e.g., patent, financial, and market data). Our 2.0 SaaS platform will enable substantial processing of very large datasets before runtime, entity resolution between very large datasets, and real-time processing in a scalable, distributed computing environment.

We need a versatile Software Engineer who wants to leverage new technology and is excited about the big picture related to development, from writing great code to deploying it scalably. It’s a challenge and a fun opportunity for someone looking to make the next big platform that the world is going to use.

On top of that, we also care about the person behind the Software Engineer. Every role is a leadership role (from an analyst to the founders), and everyone owns at least one major project. Ownership means owning the technical and the business goals of that project, and working with others to reach those goals.

Primary Responsibilities:

* In this role, you will lead a major project related to the development of v2.0 of our platform. To do so, you should be excited to:
* Develop scalable code and endpoints for processing very large datasets using
* Python, SQL, and AWS tools. Previous experience with Pyspark is a plus.
* Consider how to enable distributed computing and scalable run-time processing, using AWS resources and CI/CD best practices. Previous experience withOpenSearch, FastAPI, Docker, Airflow, and Terraform a plus.
* Understand the business implications and customer journey for the project you will lead and make sure what you create provides those business goals.

In addition, you should be able to:

* Support the data science team with design, creation, and testing of data science models. o Support data engineering efforts to create an ETL pipeline, APIs, etc.
* Problem solve and think creatively about the big picture and solution for our customers, proactively anticipate problems, and be customer-centric in our development and design.
* Clearly document processes, methodologies, and tools used.

Our Stack: The current stack includes Python, PySpark, React, Kubernetes, EMR, Spark,  
Elasticsearch, Postgres, FastAPI, Terraform, AWS (S3, Code Commit, Code Build, Code Deploy, EC2, EMR, Glue, OpenSearch, etc.), DataBricks, Docker, Spacy, Scikit learn, Openpyxl, Streamlit, Watchdog, sklearn, seaborn, nltk, matplotlib, pandas, SQLAlchemy, and additional ML and python libraries.

Experience Required:

* B.S. in relevant technical degree
* Fluency (at least 3-5 years experience) with Python, required. Experience with Pyspark is a plus.
* Fluency (at least 3-5 years experience) with the AWS ecosystem, including tools, services, and resources that enable scalable, distributed processing, required.
* Fluency (at least 3-5 years experience) with writing complex SQL queries and analysis of data correlations, required.
* Familiarity and knowledge of data engineering; previous experience with Airflow and Terraform is an advantage; experience with graphDBs is also a plus.
* Knowledge of ML fundamentals and familiarity with popular ML libraries; previous experience with modeling is a plus.
* Proficiency with software best practices (e.g., using Git/AWS CodeCommit, writing units tests, maintaining clear documentation, etc.).
* Proficiency with project management skills, including the ability to scope out timeline, methodology, and deliverables for development, testing, and integration into the platform.
* It should be a given that the role really needs excellent written and verbal communication skills.

Compensation and Benefits:  
We provide the benefits that should be expected with a role (e.g., competitive salary, and health, dental, and vision insurance). On top of that, we tie our compensation increases (e.g., bonuses and stock options) to yours and our success.

We like to be transparent about what success looks like and we expect each team member to be active participants in their careers. We use written six-month success metrics for everyone, that are agreed upon in advance. These success metrics are tied to the role’s core competencies and clearly set out the milestones and career development that each team member that should achieve to show success.

We provide the resources to achieve that success – whether that’s access to Udemy, training, conferences, a variety of projects, etc. Like our expectations for this role in general, we expect our team members to lead the way to defining and achieving their success. If you are the kind of person who constantly wants to learn, to grow, and to build towards a bigger vision with your team, then we could be a great place to do that.

	+ We offer a diverse environment that promotes DEI efforts, values multiple perspectives and fresh thinking and which includes Aprimo HELPS, an employee resource group (ERG) that is dedicated to giving back to our local communities.
* Through its relaxed environment, Aprimo embodies a more casual “Silicon Valley” atmosphere.

	+ Staff members are not siloed into roles and for many of our teams there is no set ladder that one needs to climb to achieve growth and promotion.
	+ Rather, we emphasize an organic approach to career development in which employees can and do frequently transition into newly created roles within their own teams or transition into other departments based on their interests in exploring new skills and responsibilities.
	+ For additional learning and development, we recently rolled out Udemy, which is an online learning platform that employees have access to and which features over 200,000 courses on a wide variety of business topics.

Full Stack Developer**

**What’s the story?** 

In India, there are more than 453+ million migrants. Less than 2% of this cohort uses mobile payments to send money home. While penetration of UPI and digital banking hit the ceiling, this invisible workforce that powers most of Bharat is still stuck in a cash economy and remains underbanked. **branchX is India's first neobank enabling empathetic banking for migrant communities.** Building banking that is meaningfully accessible to every aspiring Indian goes beyond the 9-5 bustle. If you are someone who derives fulfillment from purpose-led work with the ability to experiment, innovate, fail and iterate, branchX is the playground for you.

**Location: Bangalore**

**About Us:**

Launched in June 2020, branchX is India's first neo-banking solution, enabling empathetic banking for migrant communities. Our vision is to transform the way underbanked communities manage money with a ‘hand-holding grid’ aided by intelligent technologies. Headquartered in Navi-Mumbai, we are a 100+ member impact-driven team with offices in Noida, Bangalore, Kochi, Tamil Nadu, Kolkata and other locations.

**Where do you come into the picture?** 

A highly motivated and experienced Full Stack Developer who will produce scalable software solutions. The individual should be comfortable with both front-end and back-end coding languages, development frameworks, and third-party libraries.

**What would a day in your life @ branchX look like?** 

* Work with development teams and product managers to ideate software solutions
* Design client-side and server-side architecture
* Build the front-end of applications through appealing visual design
* Develop and manage well-functioning databases and applications
* Write effective APIs
* Test software to ensure responsiveness and efficiency
* Troubleshoot, debug and upgrade software
* Create security and data protection settings
* Build features and applications with a mobile responsive design
* Write technical documentation
* Work with data scientists and analysts to improve software

**Desirables:**

* Proven experience of 4-5 years as a Full Stack Developer.
* Should be excellent in Python and PHP.
* Experience developing desktop and mobile applications.
* Familiarity with common stacks
* Knowledge of multiple front-end languages and libraries (e.g. HTML/ CSS, JavaScript, XML, jQuery)
* Knowledge of multiple back-end languages (e.g. C#, Java, Python) and JavaScript frameworks (e.g. Angular, React, Node.js)
* Familiarity with databases (e.g. MySQL, MongoDB), web servers (e.g. Apache), and UI/UX design
* Excellent communication and teamwork skills.
* Organizational skills
* Degree in Computer Science, Statistics or a relevant field.

**What expertise & experiences would you need to have to play this kind of role?** 

A strong leader who can adapt to cross-functional teams that are responsible for the full software development life cycle, from conception to deployment.

**Core Value** 

‘Empathy’ as a term has become a buzzword. At branchX, we are constantly reimagining what empathy means in action. While we are finding new ways of translating empathy at work and on the ground, we do know that it goes beyond the extension of feeling 'something' for an individual. We are combining empathy and action to uplift underbanked communities. What does this mean for you? It means you’ll be part of co-creating products for the masses. Products that are meaningfully accessed by the underserved and will directly boost India’s economy in the long term. If indulging in blue-sky thinking, innovating, and iterating to create grassroots impact makes you tickle.
