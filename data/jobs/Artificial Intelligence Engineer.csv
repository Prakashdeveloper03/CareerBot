**What you'll do (responsibilities)**


As a Research Engineer, you'll be working alongside MLEs, you will ensure the development and deployment of cutting-edge AI models. Reporting directly to our Principals in the AI team, you will be responsible for:

* Architecting and developing high-performance MLOps systems that seamlessly integrate with our AI models, enhancing both development and deployment cycles

* Competitive salary and equity
* Health coverage
* Unlimited paid vacation
* Fully-distributed culture that’s async first
* Hardware setup


As a small team going up against a field of Goliaths, we have to treat our work like an Olympic sport. Expect a lot of long nights and working weekends - we know this isn't for everyone, and we're up front and transparent about that.


If you're motivated by deeply technical problems, a seemingly never-ending uphill battle and the opportunity to build (and own) a generational technology company, we can give you what you're looking for.


This is a fully remote position with Moonvalley, and we welcome candidates from anywhere. We meet a few times every quarter, usually in a center-point between NA and India (like Dubai).


If you're excited about the opportunity to work on cutting-edge AI technology and help shape the future of sales, we encourage you to apply. We look forward to hearing from you!

Nearly every company in the world runs on custom software: Gartner estimates that up to 50% of all code is written for internal use. This is the operational software for refunding orders, underwriting loans, onboarding employees, analyzing transactions, and providing customer support. But most companies don't have adequate resources to properly invest in these tools, leading to a lot of old and clunky internal software or, even worse, users still stuck in manual and spreadsheet flows.



At Retool, we're on a mission to bring good software to everyone. We're building a new type of development platform that combines the benefits of traditional software development with a drag-and-drop UI editor and AI, making it dramatically faster to build internal tools. We believe that the future of software development lies in abstracting away the tedious and repetitive tasks developers waste time on, while creating reusable components that act as a force multiplier for future developers and projects. The result is not just productivity, but good software by default. And that's a mission worth striving for.



Today, our customers span from small startups building their first operational tools to Fortune 500 companies building mission-critical apps for thousands of users across their business. Interested in joining us? Let us know!

At this stage in Retool's journey, we'll also look to you to help build new processes and programs to help our sales team meet and exceed quota.


**WHO YOU'LL WORK WITH:**



You'll join our team of Enterprise Sales Engineers and partner closely with our Enterprise Account Executives. You'll also work cross-functionally with the rest of the go-to-market team. You'll be joining a broader team of Retools who are passionate about serving our customers, enjoy collaborating to build an incredibly innovative product, and partake in some occasional but well-intentioned sarcasm. If this sounds like you, we'd love to hear from you!

What is Amplemarket all about?
  
Amplemarket's premise is that a lot of the playbooks used by B2B sales teams that worked 5 years ago don't cut it anymore.
  
In today's environment, sales teams need to have a tremendous amount of information about their prospects to decide when is the best moment and channel to reach out in the most relevant way. You can't do this with 5 different data/sales enablement point solutions that don't share the same data schema and barely communicate with each other. Amplemarket is the all-in-one compound solution that enables this.
  
Our AI-powered sales platform helps B2B companies generate more opportunities thanks to our advanced lead generation engine, hyper-personalized sequencing, omnichannel outreach, and AI-powered smart actions. We are backed by Y Combinator, and we are powering the sales teams at some of the fastest-growing companies in the world like Deel, Moveworks, H1 and Vanta.
  
  

Are you up for a challenge? Amplemarket welcomes spontaneous applications from talented people who are eager to join our team.
  
  

We are always on the lookout for exceptional Machine Learning Engineers who want to revolutionize the future of sales, while thriving in an incredible Engineering environment.
  
  

While we may not be prioritizing this opening at the moment - and, therefore, might take a bit longer to get back to you - we review spontaneous applications regularly and if your profile stands out, we’ll definitely want to get to know you
  
  

About the Machine Learning Team
  
  

The three co-founders have an engineering and physics background (João, Luís and Mica studied Physics & Computer Science in university) and deeply value the work that engineers are responsible for.
  
  

Our main goal is to develop, deploy, and operate machine learning models that help sales teams make companies grow. This can range from creating new mechanisms to extract structured data from threads of emails, to models that classify the buying intent of potential prospects.
  
  

**Among other things, our stack includes:**  

Python, Linux, FastAPI, Docker, PyTest, SQL, MLFlow, CI/CD
  
  

We don't require you to have experience in our stack to apply.

Canopy AI (parent company of CollegeVine) is the world's fastest-growing guidance company. Our mission is to bring lifelong guidance to the next generation. Ivy, our AI-powered mentor and superconnector, presents students with timely advice, acts as a sounding board, and surfaces valuable real-world networking opportunities that can change life outcomes. Trusted by millions and counting for guidance on their professional journeys, we are growing quickly in both adoption and revenue. If you want to apply your skills to a unique and consequential mission, we invite you to write the next chapter of your career alongside talented and exceptional teammates at Canopy AI!


**About the role:**



As Canopy AI scales, we're looking to add talented engineers focused on solving real-world problems to help us build new products and scale our existing systems. Canopy AI's engineering team expects each engineer to own their work from idea into production, with focus on learning as quickly as possible. This means small batches, CI/CD, deploying to production multiple times per-day, and rapid iteration as our ideas become reality for our customers.



You'll work on a product squad alongside designers, domain experts, and other engineers to solve the correct problems and deliver our guidance technology in a safe and reliable way.



This role is fully remote.


**Responsibilities:**


* Own and rapidly deliver features across the full stack in partnership with your lead engineer
* Own problems end-to-end, and are willing to pick up whatever knowledge you're missing to get the job done
* Partner directly with functions across the business to understand their needs
* Improve engineering productivity for yourself and other engineers by creating tooling, documentation, and (of course) automated tests
* Focus on solving the problems at hand, not just writing code (although that's typically how Canopy AI delivers solutions)


**Requirements:**


* 3+ years of software engineering experience (including internships)
* Proficiency with relational databases, modern IasS platforms, (Javascript || Ruby), and MVC web frameworks like Ruby on Rails. We also make heavy use of Purescript, so experience or an interest in learning typed-functional programming is necessary.
* You see yourself first and foremost as a pragmatic problem solver who just happens to write code
* Have a humble attitude, a love for learning, an eagerness to help your colleagues, and a desire to do whatever it takes to make the team succeed
* Care deeply about the end user experience and take pride in building products to solve customer needs


Canopy AI was originally founded in 2013 in Cambridge, MA as Admissions Hero (later CollegeVine) and reaches over 20 million families annually in search of guidance. Our roots are in delivering near-peer mentorship at scale, which has since evolved to delivering lifelong guidance through AI and a vast professional network. We have raised over $66m in venture funding from dedicated investors such as Morningside Technology Ventures (Xiaomi, TikTok), the founding partner of 5Y Capital, Fidelity, University Ventures, and more. In 2020, after years of being a remote-friendly company, Canopy became a fully remote company centered on Eastern Time with a diverse cast of team members based predominantly in the United States, but also around the world."

------------------


Nooks is a platform **transforming sales reps from manual laborers to scientists**. With today's technology, sales reps shouldn't need to manually write hundreds of emails, research hundreds of websites/linkedins, and make hundreds of calls. They should instead **focus on the parts of their job that actually require people** - talking to customers, being creative, and problem-solving. With a combination of AI tools, automation and real-time collaboration, Nooks can do the rest.


**About Nooks**
---------------


* **The team:** Nooks is ~30 people. Engineering & product are mostly in SF and go to our office 2-3x/week. The go-to-market team is distributed across the U.S.
	+ The founders (Dan, Rohan, and Nikhil) met studying AI at Stanford, have published in top AI journals, Forbes 30u30, worked at Scale AI, Tesla Autopilot, etc.
	+ The engineering team has won international math & physics olympiads, has experience at Google, Facebook, Slack, Quora, Scale AI, Bolt, Snap, Flexport, and other fast-growing startups.
	+ The sales team have been top-performers at companies like Gong, Amplitude, LeadIQ, and Orum.
* **Fundraising:** we've raised ~$20M in venture capital from top-tier investors. $15M in a recent (un-announced) Series A
* **Fast growth:** in 16 months (since June ‘22) we've grown $0 $2.5M ARR. So far in 2023 we've grown over 3x and expect to 4x by EOY.


**The problem**
---------------


Sales pipeline is critical for growing companies. Many, especially B2B companies, have teams of sales/business development representatives (SDR/BDRs) or full-cycle account executives whose responsibility is to identify, contact, and qualify new potential customers. There are ~750,000 SDR/BDR's in the US alone (e.g. Airtable (https://boards.greenhouse.io/airtable/jobs/6744435002), Brex (https://www.brex.com/careers/6850017002), Databricks (https://www.databricks.com/company/careers/sales-development/business-development-representative-6933516002) and many other tech companies have sizable SDR/BDR teams)


In their day-to-day, SDR/BDRs spend time on 3 main activities:


* Prospecting & research - identify a list of potential customers using signals like industry, size, fundraising, headcount growth, new hires, job descriptions, etc.
* Email & LinkedIn messaging - write messages to those contacts to convey the problem and pitch your product. The goal is for them to book a demo
* Calling - Live phone conversations often have higher conversion than emails because they're more personal, but there's a lot more manual work involved


### ***Most of the sales rep's job can be automated with today's technology: large language models, web scraping, automation, integrations, etc.***


**Nooks today**
---------------

  

Our customers use Nooks for most of their day (avg ~3hrs/business day). Nooks currently owns end-to-end workflows around sales calls:


* AI dialer - automates the manual parts of the calling process: skipping answering machines, leaving voicemails, taking notes, logging calls, even figuring out what to say on a call
* Analytics - we record, transcribe, and analyze every call. Since these are all outbound calls with little context, these calls follow similar structure - opener, pitch, questions/objections, ask for meeting, etc. So we can answer questions like: “which reps struggle to book the meeting with prospects who showed interest” or “what are the most common objections across each of our key personas”
* Salesfloor - sales reps & managers can work together throughout the day, listen to each others' calls, give real-time advice, coaching, shadowing, onboarding, training.


Teams that use Nooks often see a 2-3x increase in reps' productivity within weeks! And we're working on adding prospecting / research workflows (to-be-announced soon!)


(https://app.nooks.in/demoroom)


### **The role**


Note: Exact job title will be commensurate with experience


We have an ambitious product vision in a nascent area - AI-powered realtime collaboration - so there are a ton of interesting technical challenges on our roadmap. We're hiring our first Machine Learning Engineer. This is a role focused on implementing ML features into Nooks. Our ideal candidate will have prior experience working in industry for a business where ML is a core part of the offering.


Responsibilities will include training production models to improve their accuracy for specific sales use cases. You will align our technical strategy with performance, cost and feasibility considerations.


### **Examples of engineering problems you may touch**


### ***These are just examples, this list is non-exhaustive, and you definitely don't need experience in all of these areas. But hopefully you find some of them exciting!***


* **Realtime audio AI & precision/recall/latency tradeoffs (algorithms & models)**
	+ We use audio data, transcription, silence detection, and several other signals to detect whether a live phone call is a voicemail, a human, or a dial tree. Here, latency is a third factor added to the standard precision/recall tradeoff because it's important we can detect humans quickly. Our approach involves LLM embeddings, few-shot learning, data labeling, and continuous monitoring of model performance in prod.
* **Smart call funnels & playbooks (data wrangling, backend eng, GPT-3, UX)**
	+ At what point in the conversation do my reps get stuck? What are the toughest questions that we need to address? Can I “program” a playbook so that Nooks will help my team standardize toward best-practices? We're using GPT-3 and other LLM's to turn companies' mostly unstructured call data into actionable strategies & feedback loops.
* **Conversation embeddings & markov models (ML modeling)**
	+ What does the anatomy of a call look like? If I say XYZ, what are the different ways the prospect might answer and the probabilities of each? Conditioned on the first half of the call, what do I say next to maximize the likelihood that I book a demo at the end of the call? Can we use LLM's to generate embeddings of conversations that we can use to cluster similar conversation patterns and predict where the conversation is headed?


**Requirements**
----------------


* Bachelor's or Master's degree in Computer Science, Machine Learning, Data Science, or a related field.
* 3+ years of industry experience, including 2+ years training and deploying ML models in production.
* Full stack ML Eng chops: proficiency in general purposes programming languages such as Python/Javascript, and with libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, scikit-learn etc.
* Expertise in areas like NLP, Deep Learning, Anomaly Detection, Transformers and Large Language Models.


Nice to haves:


* Background in an analytical field like heuristics, data science &/or statistics
* Prior experiences working in both startup and research environments

Your Role and Responsibilities  

**Who you are:**  

We are IBM ZOS (Z Operating System) - IBM Z Network Configuration Assistant Product team working on Z Enterprise Systems and we build the most secure systems for our Banking and Enterprise customers to deploy their mission critical applications. Also, We provide atmost security and Data management on Z systems. The mission critical applications run on zOS and The IBM® Configuration Assistant for z/OS® Communications Server, an optional GUI-based tool, provides a guided interface for configuring TCP/IP policy-based networking functions. You can use the IBM Configuration Assistant for z/OS Communications Server to generate the Policy Agent files.  

  

The IBM Configuration Assistant for z/OS Communications Server is a z/OS Management Facility (z/OSMF) task. z/OSMF provides a web browser interface for a variety of z/OS system management functions. When you invoke the IBM Configuration Assistant for z/OS Communications Server in z/OSMF, the IBM Configuration Assistant for z/OS Communications Server runs natively in the z/OS system and you can access it through a web browser.  

  

Through a series of wizards and online help panels, you can use the IBM Configuration Assistant for z/OS Communications Server to create AT-TLS configuration files for any number of z/OS images with any number of TCP/IP stacks per image. Using the IBM Configuration Assistant for z/OS Communications Server, there are three types of reusable objects:  

  

Traffic descriptors that define the local application, by describing the TCP traffic with ports or identifying the application using its jobname.  

Security levels that define the different ways to protect data, such as the encryption level.  

Requirement maps that map traffic descriptors to security levels. A single requirement map should contain a complete set of security requirements that will govern the level of security for multiple IP traffic types.  

  

For each TCP/IP stack, you create a set of connectivity rules that indicate the data endpoints and indicate which requirement map will govern security between the data endpoints.  

  

The IBM Configuration Assistant for z/OS Communications Server comes with a number of IBM-supplied traffic descriptors, security levels, and requirement maps that are easily applied, or you can use the IBM-supplied definitions as the basis for your own set of reusable objects.  

  

The IBM Configuration Assistant for z/OS Communications Server can dramatically reduce the amount of time that is required to create AT-TLS policy files, contributing to ease of configuration and maintenance. Because of the inherently complex nature of z/OS security, using the GUI can help you ensure that you have a consistent and easily manageable interface for implementing AT-TLS security.
