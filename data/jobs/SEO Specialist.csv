-----------


Are you looking to do the best work of your career as a marketer? Do you want to be part of a hardworking and collaborative team that will push and motivate you? Do you get excited about gen AI, Google algo updates, passing core web vitals, building content hubs, and CRO?

  

If you answer yes, yes, and yes, keep reading - we’ve got something exciting for you.


Who we are
-----------


Hi, we’re Upgrow. We are a digital marketing agency focused on growth through Paid Media, SEO, and conversion-focused design and copywriting.

  

Our team is primarily remote but has shared office space with teammates in San Francisco and San Diego.

  

We focus mainly on B2B lead generation, driving marketing qualified leads and ultimately sales for our clients to help their business bottom line. Our mission is to accelerate growth for remarkable brands – we work with businesses focused on high growth and ready to blow things out of the water!

  

Here’s how you and Upgrow can get aligned based on our core values:

* **We Have Relentless Ownership**
	+ You are results-driven, naturally competitive, and thrive on the challenge to achieve performance results for our clients as well as our internal company goals
	+ This means you set appropriate expectations with clients and internally on meeting deadlines and ensure that quality work is delivered
	+ You understand and take ownership of the outcomes and can work collaboratively with the team in achieving that without making excuses or trying to sandbag
* **We Strive for Excellence**
	+ You take pride in your craft and strive for excellence in the quality of the work produced
	+ You can lead and set the standard of excellence for the team to ensure that our clients are impressed and overjoyed by the quality of work we do and produce
* **We are Committed to Growing & Learning**
	+ You are naturally curious and enjoy learning about the latest shifts in advertising trends/evolutions, technology advancements and product developments.
	+ You see the value in running training/mentoring, introducing/improving processes and knowledge sharing
* **We Win Together**
	+ You actively seek out to make yourself available to help, share knowledge and support your teammates
	+ You are a joy to work with through open/clear communication and following company’s systems/processes
	+ You celebrate and take joy not just in your own success, but the success of others

  

We’re a small and mighty team who’s fast growing (we’ve been Inc 5000 honoree twice now) and looking to grow into a world class leading agency, driving amazing results as marketers.


Many job descriptions are quick and generic, leaving you with lots of questions. This is meant to be a comprehensive look at the role, who it’s a good fit for, and how we operate as a company. With that disclaimer, you officially can’t get mad that it’s long!

  

Our application and hiring process is more in-depth than usual, and it is because we want to make sure you’re the right fit for us to ensure you’re set up for success here at Upgrow. So please take time to read and go through our hiring processes so you know what to expect.

  

If who we are sounds like a dream place to be, then you’ve come to the right place!


Life at Upgrow
---------------


We are mostly a remote team, with some hybrid in-office, our close-knit US and international team is spread across multiple US time zones, covering coast to coast. This means asynchronous communication is paramount in order to maximize productivity and efficiency.

  

We are a high performing team that values output and results, vs input and micromanagement. This means we get sh\\*t done, no bullsh\\*t, no politics, and no excuses.

  

We are highly collaborative and very organized, where we communicate internally primarily on Slack/Zoom, use project management tools like ClickUp, Basecamp and Confluence to ensure projects/tasks are planned out and delivered on time.

  

Every week we have company-wide meetings to sync together and get company level updates (e.g. sales, ops, people), and have short 15-minute daily team huddles to ensure everyone is aligned and not blocked.

  

For fun, we run monthly virtual happy hours, have in-person lunches (where possible) and have a dedicated Slack channel for non-work chatter so you can share your favorite emojis or photos from your weekend or vacation!


What will you do?
------------------


As a Senior SEO Manager, you will be the main point of contact for 5-8 key client accounts handling account management, strategy, and project management. After studying each client and their industry, you'll develop a strategy to achieve their performance goals, not just traffic but more importantly conversions.

  

You'll then project manage the implementation of on-page, off-page, and technical SEO with the support of an SEO Specialist, content writers, and the client. You will also provide reporting and project updates to clients in recurring meetings and handle client communications. As a senior manager, you will also contribute to our SEO playbook for how Upgrow executes SEO.

 **Must Haves:**

* **Great communication skills** - you are able to distill complex SEO concepts into easy to understand terms for clients (who may not be as SEO savvy) to understand, get buy-in and appreciate the value of what we’re doing
* **Highly organized & process driven** - you’re able to use project management tools to break out that tasks need to be done by when and by who, stay on top of multiple projects and ensure client delivery is met
* **Data driven** - you don’t just make guesses as to why metrics go up or down, but are comfortable diving deep and analyzing data (e.g. GA4, Search Console, SEMRush) in order to draw actionable insights and conclusions
* **Results driven** - you have a track record of achieving results, and if you’re not getting results, you have an insatiable appetite to identify opportunities, get client buy-in and execute. You know how to identify where the opportunities are in order to move the needle, and not be focused on just checking off a checklist (although those are important)
* **Embrace AI** - you have a working knowledge of utilizing AI tools such as ChatGPT to create content and craft compelling meta data
* **Data Integration** - you have a mastery over key SEO tools such as GA4, Search Console and SEMRush, have the ability to implement conversion tracking via Google Tag Manager, and be able to build data visualizations through Looker Studio
* **Real Experience** - you have a proven track record of SEO achievements, with typically 5+ years of experience across content, technical and on/off page
* **Competitive and Confident** - you want to be in the top 1% in your chosen field of SEO. You get competitive when you get outrank and find ways to win.
* **Passionate About SEO** - your YouTube history is filled with SEO content, you are in the SEO forums, you could talk for hours about this stuff, it’s more than a job - it’s what makes you great professionally.
* **SEO content writing and editing** - you can research and write compelling copy for search engines and users alike.

 **Nice To Have:**

* Experience in B2B SaaS/Enterprise technology
* Advanced knowledge of Google Tag Manager (using regex, datalayer, javascript)
* Web development skills (using HTML/CSS, Javascript)

  

These are our SEO tech stack:

* **Analytics:** GA4, Search Console, SEMRush, Google Tag Manager, SurferSEO
* **Business Intelligence:** Looker Studio, Supermetrics
* **AI:** ChatGPT

  

Our work hours are typically your standard 40/wk. Core working hours are 8:30am to 5:30pm in your time zone (except EST which is 9am to 6pm). This means during work hours, you are in a focused environment where you are dedicating your time and attention to Upgrow with a good internet connection and good work space.


Show me the money
------------------


Alright, let’s get to the point of why your time isn’t free but valuable. Here’s what we’re offering in exchange for your services:

  

* **Competitive base annual salary** -starting from $90,000**,** but it can really vary depending on your experience, background and readiness. We're considering a range of candidates for years of experience, work history, skills, and management track record. We can chat more on the topic upfront if you're interested.
* **High bonus potential!** Annual company profit sharing, client renewals and case study bonuses (can add 20%+ to your salary if you’re a high performer!)
* **Paid health, dental, and vision**
* **Life and disability insurance**
* **Unlimited PTO**, plus 10 company holidays
* **Sweet Company swag** that will quickly elevate your social status.


Is this a good fit for me?
---------------------------


Obviously, we're biased, but here is our honest (as can be) assessment of the pros/cons of working at Upgrow — in this role.

### **Benefits to you and your career**

* **Have an impact**
	+ Because we’re a small company, every single person matters in our team. You’re not some cog in a giant machine and the work that you do matters. We need people who have ideas to bring to the table and want to take action. This is your opportunity to step up to the plate and do things your way - this is the role in your career that you'll look back on fondly and know you created something truly special and innovative.
* **Work with genuinely good people**
	+ Did we mention we want to get sh\\*t done with no bullsh\\*t? We have no room for internal politics and egos – we desire to see our clients and our team succeed without the unnecessary hindrances
* **Huge career upside**
	+ Because we are small and nimble, we’re able to identify high performers and move them quickly into larger roles and responsibilities vs. traditional conventions. We have performance incentives in place to reward high achievers
* **Hybrid setup (San Diego)**
	+ We offer the flexibility of remote work plus the advantage of in-person work to foster enhanced collaboration, engagement and connectedness.

### **Who would NOT want to take this role**


A good match for any role requires a great fit between **team members and the company.** There are amazing people who aren’t in the right time/space in their careers to thrive and appreciate every role. . . and that’s totally ok! Just trying to keep it real here.


It might not be a good fit for you, IF:

* **You want to be told exactly what to do**
	+ While we have some processes documented and our team are not newbies, we need you to bring ideas to the table and make things better. That doesn't mean you're on your own or starting from 0, but we do want you to drive with ownership and accountability. So if you're looking for more of a straightforward execution role, this is not it.
* **You’re looking for a paycheck, not a career**
	+ If you’re looking for a simple 9-5 job to collect a paycheck, then this isn’t a place. We need people who are passionate about what they do, and have strong ownership and accountability. This means sometimes you’re working longer hours in order to get the job done and ensuring work produced is to a high quality/standard.
* **You’re looking for chill, slow and easy**
	+ Being in a small agency, we pride ourselves in our ability to be nimble and move quickly for our clients. This sometimes means pivoting and executing quickly, without having all the information in front of you. You need to have a sense of urgency, and not take your sweet time because you can’t handle the stress.
* **You play not to lose**
	+ We’re looking for people who want to play to win vs. not to lose. This means you’re looking for reasons and excuses on why you can’t achieve your goals vs. figuring out what is needed in order for you to achieve your goals.
* **You want a freelance style work schedule**
	+ If your schedule requires high flexibility or you prefer working exclusively in the middle of the night, then this probably isn't your gig. If you are backpacking across Europe with sometimes spotty wifi then you're also going to have a hard time.

### **How We Hire: A Look Inside Our Hiring Process**

* **Apply Online** - Now that you have found a position that you have matched your skills and interests it’s time to apply! You will be asked to submit a video response and answer a few questions about your background.
* **Application Review** - Applications are read first by our friendly recruiter and hiring manager. If we find that you are a potential match, we will reach out by email to schedule a call with you to learn more about your skills and experience.
* **Interviews** - Our interview process consists of 3 interviews, a questionnaire, and a case study presentation.
	+ Short conversation via Zoom video with our Administrator.
	+ Conversation with our co-founders. They will give you a feel for the role/company, and ask you some questions to better understand your background, experience, and fit.
	+ Questionnaire - We will ask you to complete a small (20-25 minute) questionnaire. (This helps us understand how you think and approach common SEO tasks.)
	+ Case Study Presentation- The final step will be to share a case study of a project you are particularly proud of that illustrates your SEO strategy, execution, and ability to get results. You'll share a few slides to highlight your case study with a few peers from our SEO team.
* **You’re in!**- After the interview process, we will review everything and make a decision as a team. If it's a great fit, we'll present you with an offer and review everything on a call. If you accept you'll be part of the team and begin planning for the onboarding process!

We seek someone with a proven track record of SEO expertise to work closely with our SEO director so our boutique marketing agency can continue to deliver exceptional results for our clients.

**About Us**

Our agency (MarketingForTherapists.org) is a leading agency in our niche of providing online marketing services to mental health therapists. We’re a fully remote team, and we have a mix of part-time and full-time team members. We believe in driving great results for our clients while taking great care of our people.

Beyond our impact on their bottom line, our clients appreciate our commitment to

* Transparency (we give all the information they need to make an informed choice and don't resort to pushiness or hard sells)
* Ethics (we don't work with unlicensed therapists or those who use ineffective psuedoscientific treatments) and
* Trustworthiness (we don't recommend services that we don't think will benefit the client, and we don't recommend a more expensive service when a cheaper one would do just fine.)

Turns out, when you’re committed to doing the right thing, therapists want to hire you. We’ve been growing quickly, and we’re ready to expand our SEO team. That’s where you come in.

**The Job**

In collaboration with our SEO director, you’ll identify client needs and deliver SEO services for the therapist clients in your portfolio. You will have primary responsibility for implementing SEO optimizations, reporting, and client relationship management. Specifically, the core duties of the role are:

* Choose and apply appropriate onsite and offsite optimizations
* Generate performance reports using Semrush, Google Analytics and other SEO tools
* Provide analysis and recommendations to the client based on performance data
* Track completion of deliverables and provide ongoing verification of completed work to the SEO director and the client
* Manage client relationships by responding promptly to client communication and taking initiative to address client needs.
* Collaborate with other members of the agency team to cross-sell services and unify marketing strategy for the client.
* Deliver best-in-class quality of service that drives verifiable results - not creating pretty graphs or doing tweaks that have no impact on the client's bottom line.

This role gives you full autonomy over your day-to-day work and there’s a lot of room for scaling up your SEO ability or growing the role in a way that fits your career goals. The more initial experience you bring, and the faster you demonstrate excellence, the more you’ll be able to take on. Over time, you may gain the ability to design new services offerings for clients or spearhead strategic initiatives. Basically - if you're doing an awesome job, there's a lot of room for this role to expand.

**What It Takes**

There are two major pieces this job requires. One piece is professionalism - can you manage your time effectively, communicate well with clients, and be proactive to put your best foot forward? You can prove this to us based on how you present during your application and interview.

The other piece is the SEO expertise. We’re not interested in offering our clients smoke and mirrors, so we need a specialist who can design and implement a strategy that actually gets results. It’s okay if you’re not an expert on everything, but you should have the basics down cold. If your resume doesn't include meaningful work as an SEO specialist (preferably local SEO), this position unfortunately won't be a fit for you.

Agency experience is strongly preferred. Bonus points if you have experience working with small businesses that sell services to consumers, especially in the mental health or medical space.

**The Application Process**

We’re looking to hire immediately, although we can wait for the right person. Our process involves 1-2 rounds of interviews as well as a paid work sample. Including a cover letter, sending a personalized message through our website, or highlighting specific experience that fits our needs are easy ways to stand out.

**Other Details**

* Starting pay ranges from $30 to $45 per hour depending on experience. You’ll get a $5/hr increase after the first three months, and further raises or bonuses are possible depending on how you’re able to help us scale the SEO revenue for the business. You'll be paid via direct deposit at the end of the month.
* Hours required will vary based on client demand and which responsibilities you own. You’ll likely start with 5-10 hours per week, but should easily be able to scale up to 15 - 30 hours per week, and 30-40 hours is possible.
* This is a 1099 contractor position and offers no benefits.
* Completely flexible schedule - as long as you hit your deadlines and respond to emails within a reasonable timeframe, you can arrange your work however you like.
* Open to US or Canadian residents.
* Immediate start preferred, but could delay for the right candidate.

“We Learn From Our Customers”

**SHAPING NARRATIVE IDENTITIES WITH SEO**

People live out the life stories they're narrating to themselves—*for better or worse*. TELL ME MORE® helps brands shape those narratives, inspire positive change, and in the process grow our clients' businesses.

The idea that our human experience is encased in our own stories about ourselves is a growing area of psychological research known as ""narrative identity,"" and TELL ME MORE is learning how to apply that and similar research to SEO.

Our toolkit includes design thinking, rapid prototyping, and expert storytelling to create positive change for people, profits for brand owners, and ongoing enjoyable, rewarding work for ourselves.

Visit **www.TellMeMore.co** to learn more about us.

**ABOUT STORYTELLING IN SEARCH ENGINE OPTIMIZATION**

Despite Google's insistence that it prioritizes ""helpful, reliable, people-first content,"" the web is mostly a dry remix of other content optimized for ranking. For 99% of marketers, humans are just ""traffic"" for ""funnels"" designed for the sole purpose of ""monetization.""

Not only is that kind of thinking demeaning to the people we serve, we find that it leads to mediocre client results and boring, uninspiring work.

Our insight—and inspiration—are the narratives people are already telling themselves prior to initiating a search. Great SEO engages that narrative and moves searchers in the direction of the brand. It does this through the structure and limits unique to SERPs and website pages and the contexts in which people experience them. Done right, this ""narrative-based SEO"" approach provides a framework that guides everything from SEO strategy to link building and other optimization tactics.

All of this requires a great deal of intelligence, artistry, science, craftsmanship, and storytelling expertise. Very few people have the raw talent, and even fewer are willing to work hard enough or with enough discipline over time to innovate a business approach that's truly unique and creative.

We are a leading Australian SEO agency looking for a talented SEO Specialist to join our team on a full-time basis. The successful candidate will be responsible for managing clients' websites, and improving organic rankings through SEO. The emphasis of this role is knowing WHAT to do, not just HOW to do it. Which means you will need to have an understanding of what outcomes will achieve maximum ROI for clients. You will not have many clients, but the expectation is that work is done exceptionally well as there will be ample time to make SEO decisions. You will start with about 5 clients, but will never have more than 10. This is not a client facing role, which means that you will never directly communicate with clients. However, this means that you must be on top of the campaigns at all times and proactively make SEO magic happen. Reporting will be done to the director once per week, and a log should be maintained for all SEO actions (so you must be organised). You MUST have at least 2 years of experience in a similar role.

**About Uplers:**

Our goal is to make hiring reliable, simple, and fast. Our role will be to help all our talents find and apply for relevant opportunities and progress in their career. We will support any grievances or challenges you may face during the engagement. You will also be assigned to a dedicated Talent Success Coach during the engagement.

(**Note:** There are many more opportunities apart from this on the portal. Depending on the assessments you clear, you can apply for them as well).

So, if you are ready for a new challenge, a great work environment, and an opportunity to take your career to the next level, don't hesitate to apply today. We are waiting for you!
