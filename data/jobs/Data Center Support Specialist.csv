The federally-funded National Early Care and Education Workforce Center is a joint center—the first of its kind in the country—to conduct research and provide technical assistance for states, municipalities, territories, and tribal nations looking to promote the recruitment and retention of a diverse and talented early care and education workforce. This Center builds on the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) broader efforts to support the early childhood workforce by identifying effective policies and strategies through research and evaluation, translating lessons from research for practice, and supporting innovations in states and communities through technical assistance. The Center is comprised of a core partnership that includes Child Trends as prime, the BUILD Initiative, ZERO TO THREE, the Center for the Study of Child Care Employment, University of Delaware Institute for Excellence in Early Childhood, and the University of Massachusetts Boston Institute for Early Education Leadership and Innovation. The Center’s organizational structure includes a Managing Director at Child Trends, Co-Directors of Research and Technical Assistance, a Research-to-Practice Lead, Center core and collaborating partners, and a federal Integrated Project Team as key entities for ensuring the goals of the Center are met.

**Overview of the Co-Director of Technical Assistance Role**


The Co-Director of Technical Assistance for the National Early Care and Education (ECE) Workforce Center will oversee and lead technical assistance and use their expertise, knowledge, and skills to inform all Center activities. The Co-Director of TA will serve as a key member of the Center’s leadership team, which is ultimately accountable to the Managing Director at Child Trends.


This role is designed to be strategic and visionary. As the Center’s TA liaison to the Administration of Children and Families, federally funded TA Centers, and other leaders in the field, the Co-Director will be responsible for developing, refining, and executing the overall TA strategy defined in a written plan that fills gaps in the field and is aligned to the Center’s vision for excellence and success. The Co-Director will also communicate the progress toward implementing the plan and achieving its goals including any refinements which will be based on Center and external feedback, new research, and changes in the ECE practice and policy landscape. The Co-Director will ensure that the TA strategy leverages the research and research-to-practice capacity of the Center to enhance the quality and responsiveness of TA activities and likewise ensure that TA efforts inform the research and other work of the Center.  

The Co-Director of TA will work closely and in complementary ways with the Deputy Director of TA who will ensure that the strategic vision and plan is implemented and operationalized. The Co-Director will provide broad oversight to the team including managing the day-to-day execution of universal, targeted, and intensive TA, and supervising a team of 3-5 TA Specialists who collectively build and maintain trusting relationships with ECE leaders relating to the workforce in all 50 states, Head Start regions, and US territories.  

There are two primary and equally important functions of the position. The first is to serve as the representative of the TA team within the Center, to federal program officers, in collaboration with the Managing Director of the Center, and to the broader field. Key expectations include:

* Co-leading Leadership, Coordination, and Partnership activities in collaboration with the Managing Director, Co-Director of Research & Research-to-Practice Lead to provide strategic thought partnership on the Center’s goals, audiences, and approaches for supporting the ECE workforce.
* Working collaboratively with other Center team members to actively make connections with other and complementary efforts and integrate findings to develop and deliver meaningful products.
* Developing standards for and ensuring all TA products and deliverables are of high-quality and responsive to the field, working within and outside of the Center to guide their dissemination and use.
* Maintaining adherence to the Center’s goals, objectives, and principles, working closely with the Managing Director and the Center leadership team.
* Effectively communicating the strategy, goals, and activities of the TA team internally and with external stakeholders and other audiences.
  

The second and equally essential aspect of the Co-Director job is to oversee and direct all Center Technical Assistance, including:

* Designing the overall strategy of TA services offered by the Center and communicating it in the annual TA plan, including definitions, components, entry points, and how different components connect.
* Advising on and ensuring high-quality implementation of the TA plan/strategy across all activities and events.
* Coordinating with all cross-center partners to ensure strategic and detailed tracking of TA participant engagement, satisfaction, and other outcomes, as well as tracking outreach and responsiveness to shape future direction of the TA activities.
* In conjunction with the Deputy Director, refining the TA plan/strategy based on feedback from federal program officers, new research, changes in the policy landscape, etc.
* Ensuring that the design and execution of TA activities are tailored and responsive to and support state, territory, tribal, local, and early care and education program leaders (e.g., state/territory/tribal CCDF and PDG leaders, early childhood leaders in Head Start, child care centers, family child care, schools), and leverage existing tools and resources to fill gaps and support progress towards Center goals.
* Identifying and leveraging opportunities for TA to inform the Center’s research efforts and to build from the expertise and activities of all the Center’s partners to enhance the usefulness and quality of TA efforts.

Committed to bridging gaps in GI health management, we leverage technological innovations to make early and non-invasive health screening accessible and actionable for individuals across India. As a self-funded organisation collaborating with innovative healthcare companies, we are at the forefront of driving change in the healthcare sector.

We specialise in introducing cutting-edge medical technologies, ranging from point-of-care monoclonal antibody-based rapid tests to device-based studies like Electrogastrography (EGG), at the forefront of gastroenterology.

As a pioneering leader in Gastroenterology diagnostics, GastroLab India offers an exciting opportunity for a Clinical Application Intern to join our dynamic team.

**Position Overview:**

We seek a dynamic and motivated individual to join our team as a Clinical Application Intern for our state-of-the-art GI physiology lab assays. This is a unique , offering a development plan to progress towards becoming a Clinical Application Specialist. The ladder leads to exciting leadership levels, including Senior Clinical Sales Specialist, Senior VP, and Senior Director.

As a Clinical Application Intern, you will play a crucial role in demonstrating the utility of current and upcoming test technologies within GastroLab India’s portfolio. The role involves hands-on experience with novel diagnostic testing technologies, conducting EGG studies, and contributing to clinical analysis of real-world data generated at multiple sites.

As an intern in clinical application, your role is based on three pillars. The first pillar involves demonstrating the utility of current and future upcoming test technologies as part of GastroLab India’s portfolio. These technologies range from point-of-care monoclonal antibody-based rapid tests, ELISA and turbidimetry-based markers, LAMP PCR and device-based studies like Electrogastrography (EGG).

It is crucial to disseminate the appropriate knowledge about these novel technologies as they have a steep learning curve for users, particularly for clinicians in the field of gastroenterology. This is a very niche medicine segment, with only a few specialists in any part of the country. For example, there are at most 120 medical gastroenterologists in Delhi NCR. We aim to enable GastroLab’s Gi Physiology and Motility Diagnostic Lab with these gastroenterologists in their existing endoscopy suites. This is only possible if we can share the evidence behind the clinical utility of these novel diagnostic testing technologies.

None of the tests we work with are me-too medical devices. Each 10+ and growing range of medical devices we work with is the first of their kind. In most cases, we have absolute market leadership and are exclusive scientific partners for the inventors of these test technologies from various parts of the globe.

The technology at the heart of this profile is Electrogastrography (EGG), which has the same potential as ECG for the cardiology domain. Therefore, one of the critical responsibilities of the Clinical Application intern would be to perform the EGG studies on the enrolled patients across the selected Gi centres of excellence. This would involve interacting with the patients and clinicians to discuss the patient’s EGG study outcomes.

Regarding this aspect of the role, there are two strengths that the individual will learn to embrace. The first is to make themselves available at multiple sites within their base city and major cities in the neighbourhood. The benefit of this is being able to interact and learn from clinicians who are considered key opinion leaders in their domains and gain hands-on experience of what the real-world patient journey looks like for clinicians.

This insight will empower them to map this patient journey and provide solutions to diagnose diseases that are not only difficult to diagnose but also equally difficult to treat. Your hard work will be rewarded by being the one who can offer insights into not just the appropriate diagnosis of debilitating diseases like Gastroparesis but also suggest whether the possible cure would be achievable from a therapeutic or surgical intervention.

The second pillar of this profile relies on clinical analysis of the real-world data generated at multiple sites. The strength to be embraced from this aspect is working with the end goal in mind. Awareness that each enrolled patient will represent a different clinical phenotype and each data point is crucial to the outcome's success. This real-world data in most clinical settings never gets to see the daylight due to the non-existent priorities of publishing real-world data. This is something you will get to address and be the change agent.

The testament to our unwavering focus on ensuring our collaborated projects impact actual patient care is that the last concluded Indian Society of Gastroenterology Annual Congress had three poster presentations, two of which won the first and the third prize.

The third aspect of this profile entails acquiring market intelligence. Our primary objective is to identify the unfulfilled need for better diagnostic tools pertinent to Indian disease epidemiology. The portfolio of GastroLab India facilitates a fundamental change in GI disease diagnostics and unveils future disease implications beyond the GI tract. The candidate on this profile would be expected to contribute towards this cause.

A typical day for an intern at our institution would involve conducting EGG studies at Apollo Hospital on Monday and discussing the report outcomes with the gastroenterologists. On Tuesday, the studies may take place at Fortis Hospital, and on Wednesday, the intern may travel to Jaipur to present the scientific deck to an eminent gastroenterologist at a premier centre of excellence.
