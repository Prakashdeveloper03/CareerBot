------------------


Nooks is a platform **transforming sales reps from manual laborers to scientists**. With today's technology, sales reps shouldn't need to manually write hundreds of emails, research hundreds of websites/linkedins, and make hundreds of calls. They should instead **focus on the parts of their job that actually require people** - talking to customers, being creative, and problem-solving. With a combination of AI tools, automation and real-time collaboration, Nooks can do the rest.


**About Nooks**
---------------


* **The team:** Nooks is ~30 people. Engineering & product are mostly in SF and go to our office 2-3x/week. The go-to-market team is distributed across the U.S.
	+ The founders (Dan, Rohan, and Nikhil) met studying AI at Stanford, have published in top AI journals, Forbes 30u30, worked at Scale AI, Tesla Autopilot, etc.
	+ The engineering team has won international math & physics olympiads, has experience at Google, Facebook, Slack, Quora, Scale AI, Bolt, Snap, Flexport, and other fast-growing startups.
	+ The sales team have been top-performers at companies like Gong, Amplitude, LeadIQ, and Orum.
* **Fundraising:** we've raised ~$20M in venture capital from top-tier investors. $15M in a recent (un-announced) Series A
* **Fast growth:** in 16 months (since June ‘22) we've grown $0 $2.5M ARR. So far in 2023 we've grown over 3x and expect to 4x by EOY.


**The problem**
---------------


Sales pipeline is critical for growing companies. Many, especially B2B companies, have teams of sales/business development representatives (SDR/BDRs) or full-cycle account executives whose responsibility is to identify, contact, and qualify new potential customers. There are ~750,000 SDR/BDR's in the US alone (e.g. Airtable (https://boards.greenhouse.io/airtable/jobs/6744435002), Brex (https://www.brex.com/careers/6850017002), Databricks (https://www.databricks.com/company/careers/sales-development/business-development-representative-6933516002) and many other tech companies have sizable SDR/BDR teams)


In their day-to-day, SDR/BDRs spend time on 3 main activities:


* Prospecting & research - identify a list of potential customers using signals like industry, size, fundraising, headcount growth, new hires, job descriptions, etc.
* Email & LinkedIn messaging - write messages to those contacts to convey the problem and pitch your product. The goal is for them to book a demo
* Calling - Live phone conversations often have higher conversion than emails because they're more personal, but there's a lot more manual work involved


### ***Most of the sales rep's job can be automated with today's technology: large language models, web scraping, automation, integrations, etc.***


**Nooks today**
---------------

  

Our customers use Nooks for most of their day (avg ~3hrs/business day). Nooks currently owns end-to-end workflows around sales calls:


* AI dialer - automates the manual parts of the calling process: skipping answering machines, leaving voicemails, taking notes, logging calls, even figuring out what to say on a call
* Analytics - we record, transcribe, and analyze every call. Since these are all outbound calls with little context, these calls follow similar structure - opener, pitch, questions/objections, ask for meeting, etc. So we can answer questions like: “which reps struggle to book the meeting with prospects who showed interest” or “what are the most common objections across each of our key personas”
* Salesfloor - sales reps & managers can work together throughout the day, listen to each others' calls, give real-time advice, coaching, shadowing, onboarding, training.


### **Teams that use Nooks often see a 2-3x increase in reps' productivity within weeks! And we're working on adding prospecting / research workflows (to-be-announced soon!) (https://app.nooks.in/demoroom)**


### **The role**

  

We're looking for a Customer Success Manager/Senior Customer Success Manager. Exact title will be commensurate with experience.

  

### **Responsibilities**


* Develop and maintain strong relationships with customers, understanding their business goals and helping them achieve these goals through Nooks' solutions.
* Onboard new clients, ensuring a seamless integration of Nooks' solutions into their sales processes.
* Conduct regular check-ins with clients to assess satisfaction, address any issues, and identify opportunities for growth and optimization.
* Collaborate with the sales team to identify expansion opportunities within the existing customer base.
* Provide feedback to the product development team based on customer input and evolving needs.
* Develop and implement strategies for customer retention and success, including training materials and usage best practices.
* Monitor customer health metrics and develop action plans to address areas of concern.
* Serve as the voice of the customer within Nooks, influencing product development and business strategies.


### **Requirements**


* 2+ years of experience in customer success, account management, or a similar role in a B2B SaaS environment.
* Strong interpersonal and communication skills, with the ability to engage effectively with various stakeholders.
* Proven track record of driving customer satisfaction, retention, and expansions.
* Ability to understand and articulate technical concepts and derive solutions.
* Excellent problem-solving skills, with a proactive approach to addressing customer issues.
* Familiarity with CRM tools and SEPs.


### **Bonus if you have**


* Experience as an SDR/BDR and familiar with cold calling
* Familiar with Outreach, Salesloft, Salesforce, and HubSpot.
* Worked with a Customer Success Platform such as Vitally, Planhat, or ChurnZero
* Passion for technology and innovation, with a keen interest in AI and sales productivity tools.

**Life at Abridge**
-------------------


At Abridge, we’re driven by our mission to bring understanding and follow-through to every medical conversation. Our culture is founded on doing things the “inverse” way in a legacy system—focusing on patients, instead of the system; focusing on outcomes, instead of billing; and focusing on the end-user experience, instead of a hospital administrator's mandate.


Abridgers are engineers, scientists, designers, and health policy experts from a diverse set of backgrounds—an experiment in alchemy that helps us transform an industry dominated by EHRs and enterprise into a consumer-driven experience, one recording at a time. We believe in strong ideas, loosely held, and place a high premium on a growth mindset. We push each other to grow and expose each other to the latest in our respective fields. Whether it’s holding a PhD-level deep dive into understanding fairness and underlying bias in machine learning models, debating the merits of a Scandinavian design philosophy in our UI/UX, or writing responses for Medicare rules to influence U.S. health policy, we prioritize sharing our findings across the team and helping each other be successful.

**Diversity & Inclusion**
-------------------------


Abridge is an equal opportunity employer. Diversity and inclusion is at the core of what we do. We actively welcome applicants from all backgrounds (including but not limited to race, gender, educational background, and sexual orientation).
