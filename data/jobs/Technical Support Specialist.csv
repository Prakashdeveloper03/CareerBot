About Icario


In 2020, Revel + NovuHealth joined forces to create Icario because we knew we could do better together—creating value by uniting pioneering technology, data science, and behavioral insights to make the world a healthier place, one person at a time.  

There is an island in the Aegean Sea where people live extremely long lives. They’re happy, too. Families are close. They eat well. They exercise. And they stay connected with each other, and not just by smartphone. This got us thinking. What if we apply what we learn from the Blue Zone island of Ikaria (our namesake), add pioneering technology and exabytes of data, and help healthcare connect better with everyone? We’ll have a lot more healthy, happy people, and that’s a pretty good thing.  

As an organization, we’re a collaborative team of pioneers, inventors, and systems thinkers. We speak truth, are driven by data, and sweat the details. We’re a friendly and easygoing group, but we work hard because we are mission-driven, we know a better way, and we’re here to make it happen."

We are a leading Australian SEO agency looking for a talented SEO Specialist to join our team on a full-time basis. The successful candidate will be responsible for managing clients' websites, and improving organic rankings through SEO. The emphasis of this role is knowing WHAT to do, not just HOW to do it.

You will not have many clients, but the expectation is that work is done exceptionally well as there will be ample time to make SEO decisions. You will start with about 5 clients, but will never have more than 10. This is not a client facing role, which means that you will never directly communicate with clients. However, this means that you must be on top of the campaigns at all times and proactively make SEO magic happen. Reporting will be done to the director once per week, and a log should be maintained for all SEO actions (so you must be organised). You MUST have at least 2 years of experience in a similar role.
