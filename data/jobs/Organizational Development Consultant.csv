**Background**
--------------


UN Women, grounded in the vision of equality enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, works for the elimination of discrimination against women and girls; the empowerment of women; and the achievement of equality between women and men as partners and beneficiaries of development, human rights, humanitarian action and peace and security.


The past several years have been extremely challenging for the people of Afghanistan. Already suffering from decades of conflict and instability, Afghanistan’s human rights, governance, humanitarian, and development situations deteriorated sharply after the Taliban takeover in August 2021. This transition impacted not only the political and security situations but also had particularly severe implications for human rights, gender equality, and women’s empowerment. The United Nations and its partners recognize that humanitarian aid alone will not be enough to sustainably address the large-scale and increasing human suffering of the Afghan people in the medium and long term. As such, humanitarian efforts should be complemented and reinforced with interventions addressing basic human needs that aim to reduce the humanitarian caseload over time and support Afghans, particularly women, girls, and other vulnerable groups, to a) build resilience to shocks, b) sustain livelihoods, c) protect human rights and fundamental freedoms, d) strengthen social cohesion and build social capital, and e) preserve hard-won development gains achieved over the past two decades, including with regard to service delivery. This approach is also important for the identification and achievement of durable solutions to displacement caused by conflict, climate change, and sudden onset natural disasters.

  

The United Nations Strategic Framework for Afghanistan (UNSFA) 2023-2025 articulates the UN’s approach to addressing basic human needs in Afghanistan. In close consultations with our Member States, partners, and stakeholders, the United Nations Country Team (UNCT) has identified three complementary and mutually reinforcing joint priorities as it supports the basic human needs of the Afghan people:


Priority 1: Sustained Essential Services


Priority 2: Economic Opportunities and Resilient Livelihoods


Priority 3: Social Cohesion, Inclusion, Gender Equality, Human Rights, and Rule of Law.


With the Humanitarian Country Team, the UNCT has also agreed on two collective outcomes: to 1) reduce food insecurity and 2) reduce maternal and child mortality rates. Partners across the humanitarian-development-peace nexus have agreed to work together toward these outcomes.


In February 2024, the UNCT has endorsed the development of the country-level UNCT Gender Parity Strategy. This process will be led by the UNCT Operations Management Team (OMT) with support of GTG. Country-level strategy will build on the United Nations System-wide Gender Parity Strategy, and supplementary documents, which sets targets for equal representation of women and men, with specific commitments in the following areas: leadership and accountability; senior management; recruitment and retention; creating an enabling environment; and field operations. The goal of the strategy is not simply about achieving quantitative goals, but about fostering an inclusive workplace, and transforming the institutional culture so that the Organization can fully deliver on its mandate.


As part of its commitment to integrating gender considerations into strategic system-wide processes for use by the UN, including UNCTs, UN Women is looking for a consultant to support the work of the GTG and OMT. The consultant will be reporting to the Gender Equality Coordinator (RCO).


**Duties and Responsibilities**
-------------------------------


**Deliverables**


The primary objective of this consultancy is to support OMT and GTG in creating a UNCT Gender Parity Strategy, taking stock of various initiatives undertaken to date in this regard, as well as identifying any gaps. The final document will take stock of response composition figures, but also various recommendations made to date for special temporary measures and set annual targets to recruit and retain female staff and improve a safe and conducive working environment.


The envisaged time frame of the consultancy is estimated to be 23 working days (13 days homebased, 10 working days in Kabul) during the period from March to May 2024. Payment will be made upon satisfactory receipt and approval of the following deliverables:

UN Women, grounded in the vision of equality enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, works for the elimination of discrimination against women and girls; the empowerment of women; and the achievement of equality between women and men as partners and beneficiaries of development, human rights, humanitarian action and peace and security. In Indonesia, UN Women works with the government, civil society organizations, academia, the media, and the public and private sectors to address national priorities of gender equality and women’s empowerment. Placing the advancement of women’s rights at the centre of our work, UN Women Indonesia focuses on (1) women, peace, and security (2) ending violence against women (3) women’s economic empowerment. Furthermore, UN Women coordinates and promotes the UN system’s joint work in advancing gender equality. UN Women Indonesia Country Office is looking for a consultant to provide copy editing services on UN Women publications as needed. The Consultant will not be engaged on a full-time basis but only when required by the UN Women Indonesia Country Office.


UN Women Indonesia Country Office (CO) hosts the ASEAN liaison office which extends support to ASEAN and its Member States in advancing Women's Peace and Security (WPS) agenda in line with global normative frameworks. UN Women Indonesia launched a five-year project, Empowering Women for Sustainable Peace: Preventing Violence and Promoting Social Cohesion in ASEAN. The project funded by the Governments of Canada, the United Kingdom and the Republic of Korea supports efforts by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and its 10 Member States to promote women's participation and leadership in conflict prevention, resolution and recovery. The project puts into action recommendations made in the ASEAN Regional Study on Women, Peace and Security, released in March 2021, as well as United Nations Security Council resolutions that made women, peace and security a global agenda. Region-wide, the project works to promote and implement policy frameworks such as the ASEAN Regional Plan of Action on Women, Peace and Security; capacity-building activities such as training, workshops, dialogues and consultations; and exchanges of knowledge and good practices. The project also does country-level activities in Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, Viet Nam, Cambodia and Timor-Leste.


The WPS agenda was formally initiated by the landmark UN Security Council Resolution 1325 (2000), which was adopted on 31 October 2000. UNSCR 1325 reaffirmed the important role of women in the prevention and resolution of conflicts and peace-building initiatives. It stresses the need for women’s equal participation and full involvement in all efforts to maintain and promote peace and security. UNSCR 1325 also urges all stakeholders to take action to increase the participation of women and calls on the UN member states to incorporate gender perspectives into all of its peace and security agenda. It also calls on stakeholders to take special measures to protect women and girls from gender-based violence, particularly rape and other forms of sexual abuse, in situations of armed conflict.

UN Women, grounded in the vision of equality enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, works for the elimination of discrimination against women and girls; the empowerment of women; and the achievement of equality between women and men as partners and beneficiaries of development, human rights, humanitarian action and peace and security. Placing women’s rights at the centre of all its efforts, UN Women leads and coordinates United Nations system efforts to ensure that commitments on gender equality and gender mainstreaming translate into action throughout the world. UN Women provides strong and coherent leadership in support of Member States’ priorities and efforts, building effective partnerships with civil society and other relevant actors.


UN Women in Bangladesh supports the government to implement commitments to international normative standards on gender equality and women’s human rights. In line with the UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) for 2022-2026, UN Women Bangladesh Strategic Note (2022-2026), defines UN Women’s strategic engagement in Bangladesh. The country strategy focuses on strengthening the national structures and mechanisms for gender mainstreaming in policies, plans and budgets; supporting efforts to prevent and eliminate violence against women; promoting women’s access to decent and safe work; promoting policies and government investment in women’s empowerment and resilience building in the context of climate change, humanitarian crisis as well as other threats to peace and security.

The programme promotes women’s participation and leadership in the camps and host community, peace and social cohesion building activities, and gender-responsive policing.


The key focus areas of the programmatic interventions include:


i. Enhancing the capacities of Rohingya and host community women and girls to participate in decision-making and increase their access to multi-sectoral services;


ii. Increasing the advocacy and leadership capacities of Rohingya and host community women-led organizations (WLOs);

**Company Description**
-----------------------

  

The Dignity Restoration Project (DRP) is a racial justice initiative that seeks to compensate and restore the dignity of Detroiters who lost their homes due to unlawful property tax assessments. Black homeowners were paying 6x the property tax rate of white homeowners, due to unlawfully inflated property tax assessments. DRP seeks to mobilize resources to compensate the hardest hit households in Detroit – low income residents who lost their homes to property tax foreclosures despite being exempt from paying property taxes in the first place.


DRP has three goals: (1) Halt discriminatory property tax administration, by drawing attention to this local and national issue; (2) Compensate households who were foreclosed on, starting with the hardest hit; and (3) Change the narrative about the foreclosure crisis, acknowledging the trauma and restoring dignity.


The Global Development Incubator (GDI) initiated an exploratory phase in September 2022 to validate the viability of the concept. With that foundational work nearly complete, we are now recruiting for fundraising leadership. So far we have received support from the Ford Foundation, Hudson Webber Foundation, Compton Foundation, and a group of donors affiliated with GDI.


The Dignity Restoration Project was developed through the work of Prof. Bernadette Atuahene, a property law scholar focusing on land stolen from people in the African Diaspora. Prof. Atuahene initiated the Project and will continue to serve as a member of the DRP board. The DRP board also consists of a number of local Detroit community leaders and residents affected by the property foreclosure crisis. Sarida Scott serves as the local project lead, working in partnership with Chintan Maru, Managing Director at GDI. GDI will continue to serve as an incubator, thought partner, and organizational capacity provider. DRP is also partnering with SPARQ, a behavioral science “do tank” from Stanford, to develop a research approach and process for evaluating the impact of the project. This diverse set of accomplished partners brings additional expertise and depth to the project.

**Job Description**
-------------------

  

The Fundraising Consultant will play a critical role in securing multi-million funding to support the compensation fund and operations of the Dignity Restoration Project. The Fundraising Consultant has responsibility for implementing the DRP fundraising strategy that aligns with our mission, vision, values, and centers on developing partnerships and relationships, as opposed to merely transactional donations. The Fundraising Consultant will have a solid understanding of different fundraising strategies for non-profit enterprises, including philanthropic grants, corporate and government funds, and individual giving.


The Project is planned in phases. Phase I fundraising will include operations support and compensation funds for approximately 2000 beneficiaries, an amount approximated at $10 million dollars. We are planning subsequent fundraising rounds, building momentum in Detroit and establishing an exemplar for the country.


This is an independent contractor position. Must be able to work with a remote team across multiple time zones.

**Specific responsibilities:**

* Understand the DRP mission and establish fundraising criteria that supports the integrity of our mission and intent of the DRP project to repair dignity and compensate homeowners.
* With GDI team, creation, development and implementation of a fundraising plan to support the long-term financial goals, sustainability and future growth of DRP.
* With GDI team, build strategy for developing long-term marketing and communication plan with donors that includes long-term relationship-building goals, aligning goals and processes with fundraising goals and social media/marketing materials, and tracking current donor contributions and outcomes.
* Develop a list of well-aligned potential donors and grants, research potential donors and grants, and build the pipeline of potential donors and grants.
* Write funding and contract proposals and reports.
* Collaborate with other team members to gather and integrate stories, data, and research to develop a compelling and accurate narrative for fundraising.
* Manage, report on, and ensure timely follow-up on donor and contract related tasks, deliverables, and timelines.
* Work with team members to manage impact data and report on key metrics related to donors and contracts and to provide data for DRP marketing materials.
* Maintain a database of fundraising and contract relationships and opportunities, including maintaining contacts and tracking relationship-building processes, funds received, pipeline, and deadlines.

The Partnerships Incubator works with USAID headquarters and Missions to identify and engage new and local partners, provide training and capacity-building assistance, and develop tools, resources, and models to advance USAID’s partnership goals.

**About Kaizen**


Kaizen, A Tetra Tech Company, is an incubator for innovative, scalable solutions that address emerging market challenges and opportunities. Our proven solutions catalyze locally driven, organizational, and institutional performance improvements and shift the development model into one that is bottom-up and ongoing. We leverage existing knowledge, new technologies, and innovative business models.


Kaizen is hiring a motivated professional looking to create social impact in a dynamic and rewarding work environment. We seek applications for the **Training Consultant** position for the USAID-funded Partnerships Incubator. This five-year project began in October 2019 and ends on September 30, 2024.

**About the Partnerships Incubator**


USAID aims to diversify its partner base by removing barriers to engagement and creating avenues for new and nontraditional partners to work with the Agency. The Partnerships Incubator was set up as a global service hub to address this need by amplifying USAID’s external communications efforts to strengthen and diversify the Agency’s partner base, expanding Agency capacity for partnerships, and supporting partner organizations working with USAID.


The Partnerships Incubator works with USAID headquarters and Missions to identify and engage new and local partners, provide training and capacity-strengthening assistance, and develop tools, resources, and models to advance USAID’s partnership goals. The project also designed, developed, and launched WorkwithUSAID.org, a free, USAID-funded resource hub designed to connect partners to peers and experts, improve their organizational readiness, and prepare them to receive USAID funding.

**Position Overview**


The Local, Faith, and Transformative Partnerships (LFT) Hub within USAID’s Bureau for Development, Democracy, and Innovation (DDI) strengthens the Agency’s ability to partner with new, local, and nontraditional partners by lowering barriers to partnership and strengthening capacity to work with the Agency. In support of their efforts, the LFT Hub would like to establish a standardized, post-award training program that can be delivered to partners by USAID staff at the initiation of new awards. The program would provide partners with a foundational understanding of what is required to successfully manage and implement a USAID assistance award.


The **Training Consultant** will play a key role as part of a team to advise on and support the implementation of the most appropriate and viable methodologies and pedagogical approaches to designing and developing a comprehensive training program for recently awarded USAID partners, typically receiving their first award. The program will provide tools and training that transfer the knowledge and skills required to successfully implement a USAID project. The team will leverage existing materials developed by USAID and the Incubator. New training materials will be developed as appropriate, based on previous projects and current services, which can be customized to meet the specific context of the LFT Hub and participating organizations’ needs.


Program content may include discussions and supporting materials about addressing NUPAS gaps; clearing special award conditions; aligning expectations, policies, and systems between USAID and the partner; completing standard forms and other routine reporting requirements; drafting annual work plans; drafting an MEL plan; onboarding, payroll, and procurement; financial budgeting and planning for audits; team-building and project management; relationships and relationship building; communications; marking and branding; and closeout requirements, among others.
