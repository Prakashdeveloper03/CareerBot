**Why SIG?**



At SIG, we don't just follow the industry standards; we set them. Our approach is rooted in our core values: **Client Centricity**, clients are at the heart of everything we do; **Trust, Honesty & Integrity**, we always do the right thing, even if it's not easy; **Higher Education Experience**, with SIG you know you are always working with seasoned professionals, and each new team member is surrounded by peers who bring knowledge and wisdom to the table; **Diversity, Inclusion & Respect**, fostering an inclusive environment for all; and **Team Investment & Collaboration**, we believe in investing in our team's growth and thriving through collaborative efforts, achieving shared success.

**Business Process Analysis Consultant**



SIG is seeking a Senior Consultant to specialize in Business Process Analysis. The underlying premise of SIG's BPA methodology is that technology alone cannot solve process issues. But that technology, in concert with reimagining the process, can result in significant gains. By assembling stakeholders around the same table at the same time, the team can take a step back, map the current process, and identify the obstacles and opportunities for improvement. In our experience, by gathering people at the table together – from the beginning of a project – the likelihood of success increases significantly; not simply making marginal improvements, but transformational change. These workshops not only set the trajectory toward ""ideal"" processes that take full advantage of the technology, they build consensus and momentum for change. **This position travels 50-75% of the time** to client sites, the remaining time is remote from home.

  


**Responsibilities & Required Experience of the Business Process Analysis Consultant:**  

The work you conduct with clients focuses on developing action plans to implement new business processes


* **Conduct Workshops**: A large portion of your time, you will lead workshops with clients that:
	+ Help clients determine process gaps and opportunities for innovation
	+ Bring together cross-functional teams to develop process maps to identify ideal processes
	+ Assist clients in creating significant changes to current business processes
	+ Motivate large groups of stakeholders to reflect on the current business state and take action to create a new business state
* **Process Mapping**:
	+ You have demonstrated experience developing process maps and process redesign and will develop new processes that go beyond simply deploying new software
	+ You will help stakeholders identify common process themes such as choke points, layering, end runs and shadow systems
* **Fit/Gap analysis**:
	+ You will analyze business processes as they relate to existing administrative processes and technology including an ERP system within a college or university setting
	+ Collaborate with software Subject Matter Experts to take full advantage of technology – from ERPs to point solutions
	+ You will apply findings to existing administrative software systems

**Results you will achieve:** The group then pivots to overcome those symptoms by taking a ""horizontal"" approach – working across organizational boundaries. Outcomes include:


* Better service for ""customers"" – students, faculty, staff, patrons

Streamlined operations * - fewer steps, simpler processes, enter data once
* Take location and time out of the process – visibility to all stakeholders 24/7
* Greater efficiency and better use of everyone's time
* Focus on strategic questions
* Shorten cycle times
* Significant improvements, not just marginal change
* Improved collaboration and fewer organizational silos
* Eliminate/reduce errors and re-work
* Take full advantage of technology

  


**BPA Consultants will have the following Qualifications:**


* **Higher Education Work Experience**: 5 or more years of experience working within a higher education institution
* **Tech System Familarity:** You have worked with ERP's such as: Workday, PeopleSoft, Banner, Colleague, etc. You also have familiarity with an ecosystem of tools – e.g., Salesforce, Slate, Navigate, Starfish, Parchment, etc.
* **Project Management experience:** you have led projects that impact multiple departments
* **Problem Solver**: Highly self-directed with a history of developing solutions
* **Communication Skills**: Sound written and oral communication skills with the ability to listen deeply and a proven customer service approach
* **Prioritization:** Ability to negotiate multiple, competing priorities using tact and diplomacy with clients
* **Travel:** The ability to travel overnight up to 75% of the time
* **Credentials:** Lean or Six Sigma experience desirable
