Murmuration is a nonprofit organization that amplifies the power of civic engagement by providing data, digital tools, and research-driven insights to community-focused organizations so that together we can create an America where everyone can lead healthy, free, and dignified lives.


Every day, people are trying to shape our future for the better. Fighting for water that’s safe to drink. Schools that serve students equitably. Gun laws that make sense. And rallying people who care like we do. And yet too often the skillful organizers working to mobilize communities lack access to technology that could supercharge their efforts. Knocking on every door instead of knowing which will open most easily. And going up against outside interests that have half the heart, but twice the tools.


In communities across America, Murmuration’s partners are leveraging our data, tools, and insights to help thousands of organizers orchestrate millions of individual people to do big things together. Demand big things together. To create the world they want. Together.

**About the Position**


Murmuration is looking for a technology leader to help drive the next phase of our growth.

You will be the most senior technology voice in the organization and an essential piece of our Executive Leadership Team. Our CTO will be our technical guide and executive collaborator on how technology makes more impact possible through our Partners. You will develop and grow a large technology team, providing strong management, direction, and technical leadership. You believe in the power of people and teams to build incredible tools and are committed to a Partner-centric perspective on making progress and on guiding our technology roadmap. You will play an essential role on the executive team and ensure that the way we understand, embrace, develop, and deploy technology is deeply connected to our Theory of Change and consistent with our principles. We are both a sector-defining and defying impact organization and a world-class technology organization. Understanding and embracing both aspects of our identity, strategy, and culture are essential to our success and to making the kind of transformation we believe is possible and necessary in the world happen.

**What You’ll Do:**

* Provide overall organizational leadership and strategic direction in close collaboration with other colleagues on the Executive Leadership Team. Identify and leverage opportunities to integrate our work across teams and functions
* Thoughtfully coordinate our Technical Roadmap with our Product Roadmap, ensuring alignment with our overall strategic plan and Theory of Change
* Integrate our technical processes with our Partnerships and Support processes to ensure we put our Partners first AND learn everything we can from their experiences, to better inform our solutions
* Grow and lead a world-class technology team, providing empathetic leadership and strong team management, guidance, and direction to your team leaders
* Set up strong team structures, ensuring that functions and roles are streamlined to facilitate effective collaboration and support efficient processes
* Empower your Technology Teams with expert technical direction and clear decision-making, ensuring that our technical infrastructure is secure, performant, and flexible enough to develop and deploy new ideas quickly
* Assess new and emerging external technologies for opportunities to partner or integrate as new ideas rise through our teams
* Serve as a speaker and technical ambassador for the organization at strategic events with funders, partners, etc. throughout the year, as needed
* Create and track progress to goals and objectives for the Technology Division, in collaboration with the Executive Leadership Team
* Foster a cohesive and inspiring team culture, rooted in a strong commitment to collaboration, technical excellence, and continuous learning
* Coordinate with Operations and other teams to ensure we develop sound Licensing, Data, and Privacy policies and practices
