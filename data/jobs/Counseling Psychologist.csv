Help Therapy seeks innovative psychologists in Washington with telehealth experience who are driven by the vision of treating the entire individual. By joining us, you can significantly reduce instances of preventable patient harm and enhance comprehensive care outcomes.

Founded in 1993, Help Therapy has consistently worked towards broadening access to top-tier mental health services.

At Help Therapy, we alleviate administrative tasks such as referrals, billing, marketing, credentialing, and compliance, allowing you to function akin to a private practice. We aim to transform your envisioned practice into reality.

**About Spinal Cord Stimulator Evaluations**

SCS represents a novel approach to managing chronic pain and is increasingly emerging as a preferred alternative to medications or back surgery. Yet, the procedure is not devoid of risks. The implanted SCS device connects directly to the patient's nervous system. Research underscores that psychological variables such as anxiety, depression, or inadequate coping mechanisms can adversely impact post-SCS care outcomes. This is where your expertise becomes invaluable in ensuring the patient's safety.

Patients contemplating SCS must first undergo psychological evaluations to ascertain the procedure's appropriateness for them. These evaluations amplify the chances of favorable care outcomes. Conducting a psychological evaluation for SCS entails a clinical interview and a mental status examination, all executed virtually and typically completed within an hour.

**How Help Therapy Works**

Become a part of our team in under a week and instantly start attending to patients for Psychological Evaluation Clearances. Our care team will manage your referrals for patients necessitating SCS pre-surgical psychological evaluations via telehealth. Billing for every psychological evaluation will be seamlessly handled by Help Therapy.

Perennial Wellness PLLC (PW) invites applications for a 24-month, full time (24+ patient hours/week) licensed psychologist or LCSW to work with patients exclusively via telehealth. LMSWs who are an excellent fit are encouraged to apply, as well.

*The candidate must either be licensed in NY or CT, or open to obtaining licensure in both states.*

**Practice Overview:**

PW is a thriving, full-fee group practice based in Westport, CT, serving patients via telehealth across New York and Connecticut. Website: www.perennialwellnessllc.com.

At PW, we are a collaborative team of psychologists and social workers, and we believe that women deserve a holistic, evidence-based approach to mental health care. We understand the unique experience of womanhood. From navigating early adulthood, to the perinatal and postpartum period, to motherhood, perimenopause and beyond, we integrate evidence-based approaches to mental health care with a deep understanding of interpersonal neurobiology, child development, and attachment philosophies.

Our team values close collaboration with one another, in the form of supervision, case consultation, didactic trainings, and team building experiences. We offer our patients:

1. Individual Therapy: Our approach combines a holistic approach to treatment with a feminist application of cognitive behavioral therapy. Treatment subspecialties include: Peripartum Mood and Anxiety Disorders (PMADs); Anxiety; OCD; Perfectionism; Relationship Concerns; Grief and Loss; Career Counseling; and Parenting a Child with Special Needs.

2. Parenting Support: Our work with parents is grounded in interpersonal neurobiology, respectful parenting principles and the DIR Floortime model.

3. Executive Functioning Skills Coaching: We integrate a nuanced awareness of a woman’s neurobiology with actionable, skill-building interventions to help each woman strengthen her productivity, organization, time management skills, and more.

All individual therapy patients are served via telehealth and while the position is fully remote, there are opportunities for in-person group work, workshops, etc. to be facilitated at the applicant’s discretion, if the applicant is local to Westport, CT.

At PW, teletherapy allows women who are seeking specialized, evidence-based treatment to receive high-quality, individualized care, regardless of their physical location. Teletherapy allows for accessibility and convenience when it’s hard for women to get into the office, which is often the case for women in the peripartum period.

**Clinician’s Responsibilities:**

* Conduct psychiatric intakes with diagnosis, treatment planning and coordination of care with outside providers.
* Conduct individual psychotherapy for a caseload of 24+ patients through an integrative, evidence-based approach.
* Conduct dyadic parent sessions as needed focused on providing supportive interventions to navigate complex parenting-related challenges and dynamics.
* Attend and participate in weekly individual supervision with Dr. Levine, as well as twice monthly group supervision with the full PW team.
* Opportunities to develop a smaller caseload focused on Executive Functioning Skills Coaching for women with ADHD, under additional specialized supervision from clinical neuropsychologist Dr. Danielle Auslander, PsyD.

The candidate will have input into the specific days/times that she holds “office hours,” as this is a benefit of telehealth as a treatment modality. The candidate must be willing to see patients during evening hours one day per week (4p – 8p).

This position is ideal for an applicant (1) with a strong interest in women’s mental health and (2) who is seeking to learn more about how to cultivate a thriving telehealth practice within a private practice setting. The candidate will receive training and support in all clinical aspects of her work, as well as in the business-related aspects of maintaining an ethical, legal, and successful telehealth private practice.

**PW is seeking to hire an applicant who is:** 

1. Passionate about women’s mental health.

2. Eager for mentorship and training in modern private practice development.

3. Motivated to develop competencies in building and sustaining an effective, legal and ethical telehealth practice.

4. Highly autonomous and organized.

5. Honest, collaborative, and eager to grow as a part of a team.

Emma Levine, PhD is the Director of PW. She is a psychologist and clinical supervisor. She was formerly the Assistant Director at Cognitive Therapy for Women in New York City, where she helped to develop and implement their Postdoctoral Fellowship supervision training program. She completed her APA-accredited pre-doctoral internship training at Andrus Children’s Center in Yonkers, NY.

Dr. Levine has served as an Adjunct Professor in the Graduate School of Education at Fordham University. She has advanced training in the assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of Perinatal Mood and Anxiety Disorders (PMADs) from the Selini Institute in New York City. She regularly presents to parents and school communities on topics related to maternal mental health and parenting.

**Compensation & Benefits:**

* Competitive W2, fee-for-service position.
* Opportunities to remain and grow as a part of the PW team available upon successful completion of contract.
* Weekly, individual supervision is provided.
* Twice monthly team case consultation and didactics.
* A 401K plan immediately upon hire.
* Stipends for trainings and conferences.
* This position does not include health or malpractice insurance.

PW is an equal opportunity employer, and we encourage candidates from diverse backgrounds to apply. We value hiring candidates who emulate diversity of life experiences, perspective and thought. We care deeply about cultivating a community among our team that feels safe and inclusive, and that encourages important dialogues about issues of diversity among our team and our patients.

**Applicant Instructions:**  Please send a cover letter indicating your interest in this position, a C.V., and two letters of recommendation to Dr. Emma Levine by email at drlevine@perennialwellnessllc.com. Interviews will be conducted on a rolling basis, and an offer will be made when the right applicant is found. No phone calls please.

**About the Company:** If you often think: ***I wish I were more supported in my work and felt valued as a critical component in the care of my clients.*** Then let’s talk!

Clinicians are the primary focus at Blue Square. Our practice celebrates and supports our clinicians both personally and professionally so they can focus on providing the best quality care possible to the clients they see.

* Want to work with clients who are a good fit for your practice niche. We will support you in finding your niche and then tailor your client assignments so we are hitting your sweet spot.

* We can fill your caseload as long as you know how to retain a client.
* We do things for our team members because we care, not because we have to.

* Time Off: All of our team members receive paid time off and paid sick time.
