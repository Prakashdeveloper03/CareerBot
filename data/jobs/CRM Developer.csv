* Can identify a problem, build a case for it, and execute independently, leaning into ambiguity
* Foster an environment that encourages autonomy and psychological safety.
* Never accept the status quo; we need engineers and leaders who can see beyond what we have, and towards what we can build while maintaining an understanding about how to get there.
* Demonstrate pragmatic decision-making and problem-solving abilities.
* Work autonomously, lead transparently, and prioritize product and people over strict processes.
* Partner with their triad (Product Manager and Product Designer) to design, scope, and deliver solutions to help our customers manage and grow their businesses.


Tech Leads play to their strengths but are aligned with HubSpot's mission and show the leadership qualities that we've found to be most effective.


*Confidence can sometimes hold us back from applying for a job. But we'll let you in on a secret: there's no such thing as the 'perfect' candidate. HubSpot is a place where everyone can grow. So however you identify and whatever background you bring with you, please apply if this is a role that would make you excited to come into work every day.*

* **Where possible, limit the creative formatting of your documents.** If the name on your resume is an inserted image file or is styled with large spaces between each letter, for example, the redaction is likely to fail. Colors and designs are OK, but wherever possible, the text itself should just be regular text.

* **Submit PDF or .docx files only.** Other file formats, like .txt, are likely to fail redaction.
* **Please do not include personal identifying information in your responses to the application questions.** Referencing past education, work experience, and mission-alignment is OK.
* **Please do not contact the role's supervisor or any potential member of the hiring team.** If you have questions, please email careers@gfi.org.

Because we value EID at GRID Alternatives, we encourage folks from all backgrounds to apply, even if you do not meet all of the preferred qualifications.  

  

**About the Tribal Program**  

Since 2010, GRID Alternatives’ has worked with tribal communities across the United States to support their renewable energy goals and visions for a sustainable future through tribal focused programs. The Tribal Program supports tribes in asserting control over their energy resources and focuses on making project implementation feasible by leveraging state and federal programs, philanthropic dollars, and partnerships with other tribes across Indian County while working in alignment to identify, develop, finance and implement solar power projects that meet community needs, including education, hands-on training, and energy cost reductions for tribal members.  

  

Since 2018, the Tribal Solar Accelerator Fund (TSAF) , a tribal-led grantmaking program, has partnered with 85+ tribes and 50+ tribal individuals to support renewable energy development, workforce and training, and leadership development goals. The TSAF has provided tribes with access to philanthropic capital through competitive grantmaking and leadership development programs. At its core, TSAF is about more than just regranting; it’s about mobilizing and developing tribal solar projects and integrating workforce development and training, nation-building, and strengthening the energy resilience of tribal communities with visions for a clean energy outlook for generations to come. The upfront expenses to install and maintain solar systems are out of reach for many tribal communities, which is why TSAF funding has been critical to each grantee we have supported.  

Together, we are doing three key things to create a tribal renewable energy community that enhances and strengthens energy resilience and energy sovereignty by:
* Increase access to funding for Tribal communities to achieve their renewable energy goals.
* Support tribal leaders and youth in renewable energy to transform their communities
* Support Tribal partners building capacity to address their community’s energy needs and achieve their renewable energy visions.

By leveraging massive amounts of data and advanced machine learning algorithms, Hopper combines its world-class travel agency offering with proprietary fintech products to bring transparency, flexibility and savings to travelers globally. We have developed several unique fintech solutions that address everything from pricing volatility to trip disruptions – helping people travel better and save more on their trips.  

The Hopper platform serves hundreds of millions of travelers globally and continues to capture market share around the world. Ranked the third largest online travel agency in North America, the Hopper app has been downloaded over 120 million times and has become largely popular among younger travelers – with 70% of its users being Gen Z and millennials.  

While everyone knows us as the Gen Z and Millennial travel app, Hopper has evolved to become much more than that. In recent years, we’ve grown into a global travel agency and travel fintech provider that powers some of the world’s largest brands.  

  

Through HTS, our B2B division, the company supercharges its partners’ direct channels by integrating our fintech products on their sites or powering end-to-end travel portals. Today, our partners include leading travel brands like Capital One, Nubank, Air Canada and many more.  

Here are just a few stats that demonstrate the company’s recent growth:  

Hopper sells billion worth of travel and travel fintech every year. In 2023, over 1.3 billion trips were planned through the Hopper app and our HTS partnerships.  

Our fintech products – including Price Freeze, Flexibility for Any Reason and Flight Disruption Assistance – have exceptionally strong CSAT because the terms are always clear, and customers receive instant, no-questions-asked resolutions.  

Almost 30% of our app customers purchase at least one fintech product when making a booking; and consumers are 1.6x more likely to repurchase if they add fintech to their booking vs if they booked just travel.  

Given the success of its fintech products, Hopper launched a B2B initiative, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions), which represents more than 50% of the business.  

 Through HTS, any travel provider (airlines, hotels, banks, travel agencies, etc.) can integrate and seamlessly distribute Hopper’s fintech or travel inventory on their direct channels. As its first HTS partnership, the company partnered with Capital One to co-develop Capital One Travel, a new travel portal designed specifically for cardholders. Other HTS partners include Air Canada, Uber, CommBank, Nubank, Flair Airlines with many more in the pipeline.
