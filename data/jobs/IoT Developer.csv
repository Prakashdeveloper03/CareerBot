**About the company:**

Founded by ex-Apple Product and Engineering leaders, Level is redefining the smart home with technology that is simple, intuitive, useful, and invisible. We recently raised a $100M C round and we're looking to grow our engineering team.

At Level, we take a unique approach to designing products - one that shifts focus from what we make to how we make it and who we make it for. It’s an approach that results in elegant and unique solutions, raising the bar for the entire smart home ecosystem.

It’s also an approach that has led to our partnerships with Apple, Amazon (including Ring integration), Walmart, and other industry leaders – assuring that our products provide solutions that align with the technology choices and preferences of our customers.
**About the role:**
Level Home Inc. is looking for a well-rounded **Sr. Android Developer** to join our fast-growing startup. We're a passionate team of former Apple, Google, and Microsoft engineers who build products that transform people's lives.

Our Engineers work on new product development from day one, working cross-functionally with many other engineering disciplines. Android Engineers at Level Home Inc. have the freedom and flexibility to work on the technologies that truly interest them. Our Android Engineering team is highly collaborative, with all members making a large impact, regardless of seniority.
**Responsibilities:*** Develop and deliver new product features for our Android application.
* Improve engineering processes and tools to increase team effectiveness.
* Work across both technical and business-focused teams to deliver value to our neighbors.
* Promote robust and maintainable code, clear documentation, and deliver high-quality work on schedules.

* Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science or related field.


**More about Level Home:**
When we look around our homes today, we see opportunity. We see “smart” products that lack utility and connected devices that push us further apart. We see consumers with high expectations, current standards set too low, and products that simply fail to deliver.

Level Home Inc. is re-inventing the standard. We’re redefining “smart”, to center around thoughtfulness, practicality, and the people who make the problem worth solving. We approach product design with a blank slate, zero assumptions, and an open-mind because the way a problem is defined sets the stage for its solution. We couple deep expertise with unbridled curiosity, because to us “smart” means simple, intuitive, and useful.

We start with empathy, take new perspectives, and challenge existing standards. People are at the heart of what we do, and respecting their style, choices, and preferences is the first step to uncovering a thoughtful solution that truly improves their daily lives. After all, we’re not just designing products for a house, we are designing them for the people who make it a home.***Level Home Inc. is an Equal Opportunity Employer and all qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, disability or genetic information, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or national origin.***

**About SafelyYou**  

  

SafelyYou is a mission-driven company that raised $60m in 2021 through series A and series B financing and is now rapidly scaling. Our company spun out of the UC Berkeley AI Research Lab and develops artificial intelligence to support care for those with Alzheimer’s disease, Dementia, and other cognitive impairments. Alzheimer’s disease is the single most expensive disease in the US, costing an estimated $600b per year in direct and indirect costs. It affects 1 in 3 people over 85, 1 in 9 people over 65, and accounts for 1 in 5 Medicare dollars. Our first product is focused on reducing the frequency and impact of falls, the leading cause of hospitalization for those living with dementia. We have peer-reviewed results showing up to 80% fewer falls with an average of 40% fewer falls and 80% fewer ER visits from falls. We've raised capital from top VC firms, including Founders Fund, Eclipse, Foundation Capital, and Data Collective, and the largest providers in the space are actively using, expanding, and evangelizing the service. We have also been awarded grants from the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation, given the national importance of the issue. As the population continues to age, the global costs of Alzheimer’s and Dementia are expected to double over the next 10 years. With fewer and fewer young people available to provide the care needed, we must find a way for technology to bridge the gap.

Canonical supports ISV customers building on Ubuntu and Ubuntu Pro, to help them deliver fast, reliable, secure, compliant and consistent solutions. We provide the world's largest base of open source software with a full support SLA, FIPS cryptographic compliance, HIPAA and FedRAMP compliant security commitments, and the number one developer experiences. We have a number of significant competitive advantages and unique selling points. We work closely with every major public cloud to optimise Ubuntu for their environment, integrating it with their cloud-specific services and capabilities. That makes it easier for ISVs to offer their solution across all of those clouds with confidence. We also work with every major server vendor, IoT vendor, and silicon provider, to enable, optimise and certify Ubuntu on that hardware. This makes Ubuntu an outstanding choice for ISVs selling physical appliances or traditional application software.



ISVs who build on Ubuntu get ten years of security coverage guarantees which enable them to meet enterprise SLA commitments. We cover 35,000 packages in Ubuntu, and also offer ten-year security SLAs for open source components that are not packaged but which are critical components in the AI/ML supply chain, enabling Docker images and VM images to be built with those components fully certified and assured. The world's biggest brands in AI build on these Ubuntu Pro capabilities to ensure they stay focused on their product proposition rather than maintenance or compliance.



These business development roles require an understanding of the open source ecosystem and software supply chain. We support our customers with embedded support and licensing agreements, helping them build custom Docker and VM images for public cloud distribution, joint GTM planning and long term strategic partnerships. Successful candidates will work with Marketing, Product, Alliances and Sales colleagues to prospect ISV accounts, introduce our offerings, negotiate and help partners develop their products to best leverage our portfolio.
