* Support leadership by providing technical advisement on evaluation of current processes.
* Provide change management leadership for business systems improvement projects.
* Negotiate revision of goals, objectives, and deadlines with project sponsors and functional partners when necessary.
* Develop, deliver, and oversee training for internal and external project team members and stakeholders.
* Provide ongoing technical support for the production environment. Diagnose and provide resolution for production application questions and issues.
* Understand, advocate, apply, and explain the SAIF brand.
* Cultivate an awareness and understanding of the latest industry standards and trends in the areas of technology, project management, business analysis, and business process improvement.
* Participate in negotiations with solution providers/vendors acting as technical advisor to ensure solutions meet business requirements. Perform feasibility analysis of selected solutions prior to final selection.
* Explore diverse perspectives and consistently behave sensitively toward differences in cultural norms, expectations, and ways of communicating. Work effectively with others who have different perspectives, backgrounds, and/or work styles.
* Continually sustain the Inclusive Leadership Competencies (ILC) through the Explorer level on an annual basis.


ADDITIONAL FUNCTIONS:* Provide tactical and operational support for the Analytics and Data Governance body.
* Translate operational and commercial requirements from functional partners into technical requirements against which data engineers, business intelligence analysts, and data scientists can execute.


RECOMMENDED QUALIFICATIONS:* Experience: Five or more years of business analysis and project management experience.

Client’s DataStage ETL tool supports the transfer of data from the PeopleSoft source system (Financial Management Solutions (FMS), Human Capital Management (HCM), Enterprise Learning Management (ELM)) to the EPM Data Warehouse which is used to generate various reports. The current DataStage software operates on Windows 2008 physical machines which are no longer supported; therefore Client has undertaken an upgrade of the DataStage software, which includes moving the servers to supported server operating systems. The upgrade project is underway and requires the migration of approximately 1,700 server jobs to bring it to completion. With the exception of a relatively small number of jobs that still need to be migrated to the DataStage V11 Test instance, the server jobs have generally already been migrated to the DataStage V11 Test instance, and now need to be tested/fixed and migrated to the DataStage V11 Production instance. The contractor under this engagement will perform these migration tasks, supplementing Client staff members who will also be performing this work. State staff will provide project management. The contractor will work closely with the Client's Data Warehouse Team lead along with other project team members. The metadata database is Oracle 19C and the Data Warehouse is Oracle 12C. DataStage Version 11.7 on Red Hat is up and running and has already been configured. During the production batch process, data is moved from the source Oracle databases into a staging layer in the Warehouse database and then moved to a multi-dimensional layer used for reporting using Oracle Business Intelligence Enterprise Edition (OBIEE). The Warehouse nightly batch takes about 10 hours to complete each night. Each upgraded job will need to be performance tuned so that it takes the same or less time to load when compared to DataStage V 8.5."

India Systems Development Lab (ISDL) is part of IBM Systems world-wide technology development lab. Established in 1996, the Lab is headquartered in India's Silicon Valley and startup hub - Bengaluru, with a strong presence in Pune and Hyderabad. Developers at ISDL deliver technology innovations across the entire Systems portfolio - z Systems, Power / OpenPOWER Systems and Storage. The team here works across the entire stack from processor design, firmware, operating system to software defined storage. The lab also focuses on innovations, thanks to the creative energies of the teams. The lab has contributed over 400+ patents in cutting edge technologies and inventions so far.  

While computing veers towards cognitive, cloud, mobile, social, and security, the lab has significantly contributed to not just new products focused in these areas, but has also ushered in new development models such as Agile, Design Thinking and DevOps.  

  

Your Role and Responsibilities  

**Who you are:**  

We are IBM ZOS (Z Operating System) - IBM Z Network Configuration Assistant Product team working on Z Enterprise Systems and we build the most secure systems for our Banking and Enterprise customers to deploy their mission critical applications. Also, We provide atmost security and Data management on Z systems. The mission critical applications run on zOS and The IBM® Configuration Assistant for z/OS® Communications Server, an optional GUI-based tool, provides a guided interface for configuring TCP/IP policy-based networking functions. You can use the IBM Configuration Assistant for z/OS Communications Server to generate the Policy Agent files.  

  

The IBM Configuration Assistant for z/OS Communications Server is a z/OS Management Facility (z/OSMF) task. z/OSMF provides a web browser interface for a variety of z/OS system management functions. When you invoke the IBM Configuration Assistant for z/OS Communications Server in z/OSMF, the IBM Configuration Assistant for z/OS Communications Server runs natively in the z/OS system and you can access it through a web browser.  

  

Through a series of wizards and online help panels, you can use the IBM Configuration Assistant for z/OS Communications Server to create AT-TLS configuration files for any number of z/OS images with any number of TCP/IP stacks per image. Using the IBM Configuration Assistant for z/OS Communications Server, there are three types of reusable objects:  

  

Traffic descriptors that define the local application, by describing the TCP traffic with ports or identifying the application using its jobname.  

Security levels that define the different ways to protect data, such as the encryption level.  

Requirement maps that map traffic descriptors to security levels. A single requirement map should contain a complete set of security requirements that will govern the level of security for multiple IP traffic types.  

  

For each TCP/IP stack, you create a set of connectivity rules that indicate the data endpoints and indicate which requirement map will govern security between the data endpoints.  

  

The IBM Configuration Assistant for z/OS Communications Server comes with a number of IBM-supplied traffic descriptors, security levels, and requirement maps that are easily applied, or you can use the IBM-supplied definitions as the basis for your own set of reusable objects.  

  

The IBM Configuration Assistant for z/OS Communications Server can dramatically reduce the amount of time that is required to create AT-TLS policy files, contributing to ease of configuration and maintenance. Because of the inherently complex nature of z/OS security, using the GUI can help you ensure that you have a consistent and easily manageable interface for implementing AT-TLS security.  

  

**What you’ll do:**

* Proactively monitor and appropriately manage technical delivery risks, with a focus on protecting the GTC reputation with the wider business and our clients, solving and learning from issues as they arise.
* Streamline interfaces with other Practice areas, both within the GTC and more broadly, to enable high value integrated propositions, identifying complementary expertise and aligning ways of working to reduce barriers.
