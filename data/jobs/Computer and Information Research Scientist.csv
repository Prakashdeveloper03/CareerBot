WHO WE ARE
Oregon Housing and Community Services (OHCS) is Oregon’s housing finance agency. We provide financial and program support to create and preserve opportunities for quality, affordable housing for Oregonians of lower and moderate income. Our vision is that all Oregonians can pursue prosperity and to live free from poverty. Across Oregon, housing has emerged as a paramount concern. The lack of available housing, high rents and high home prices are driving rapid increases in housing instability and homelessness. The data is clear: too many Oregonians are without a safe, stable, and affordable place to call home.
OHCS is placing a greater emphasis on strategic planning and the way we invest our resources. Recently, we have restructured, refocused, and reimagined our agency. Our work has led to an increased emphasis on data, research, and customer service. We are carrying that effort forward with the Statewide Housing Plan. The plan articulates the extent of Oregon's housing problem and what we can do to address it. OHCS committed to the Housing Stability Council and our stakeholders that the plan will be responsive to the needs of the state.
OHCS released its 2022 Progress Report to update the agency’s significant progress in meeting the goals outlined in the 2019 Statewide Housing Plan. We are now more than halfway into the five-year plan.*To learn more about Oregon Housing and Community Services, visit our website:* *https://www.oregon.gov/OHCS/pages/index.aspx*

The IRB Administrator is part of the Human Subjects Division and supports the University of Washington’s IRBs. The HSD workforce/team is a community of diverse disciplines, professional fields, and areas of expertise who manage and/or conduct the confidential institutional review and approval process of proposed research activities involving human subjects at the UW and some affiliated institutions. The purpose of the review is to protect the safety, rights, and welfare of research subjects and to ensure institutional compliance with federal and state regulations and University policy.
  

  

**Position Complexities:**
  

  

The IRB Administrator must understand many complex regulatory and ethical issues and how they apply to UW research. The position requires balancing the need to assure the UW's compliance with state laws and at least five different sets of federal regulations with the need to facilitate research and with ethical considerations. To successfully accomplish this, the individual must be: (1) comfortable with making judgment calls in ambiguous situations; (2) highly organized at tracking and prioritizing work; (3) outstanding attention to detail; (4) able to write and speak in concise, accurate, and intelligible manner; (5) able to work independently with minimal supervision; (6) analytical and have problem-solving skills; (7) diplomatic and have professional interpersonal skills; (8) able to work well as part of a team; (9) have computer proficiency including MS Word, Excel, internet browsers, and email.

Independently conduct and document expedited IRB reviews of human subjects research (new applications, modifications, periodic continuing reviews), according to all applicable federal and state criteria for approval, as independently identified by the reviewer. Includes making decisions about whether waivers of specific regulatory requirements are appropriate and allowable under the applicable regulations.
  

  

**Oversight and guidance of IRB committee reviews (15%)**
  

  

Oversee and guide reviews conducted by the fully convened IRB committee for research that involves more than minimal risk. For each set of application materials, this includes: (1) Rigorous pre-review screening of all materials and interaction with the research team to identify for the IRB all regulatory issues and determinations; ensure that the materials provide all information required for the IRB to makes its decisions; and identify whether a consultant is needed to supplement the IRB's expertise; (2) Brief and advise the IRB on the application materials, issues, and regulatory requirements; (3) Write review letters to the researcher that succinctly, accurately, and intelligibly communicate the IRB's determinations, questions, and conditions of approval; (4) Accurately capture for required meeting minutes the IRB's decisions, determinations, vote tallies, and controverted issues; (5) Verify on behalf of the IRB that its conditions of approval have been met by the research team; and (6) Serve as an alternate voting member of the IRB. This participation is limited to infrequent substitutions as needed and appropriate when IRB meeting requirements will not otherwise be met.
  

  

**Regulatory determinations (30%)**
  

  

Independently make and document numerous required regulatory determinations about proposed research and scholarly activities, including: identification of activities requiring IRB review; identification of which participating groups must be considered human subjects; whether the activity is eligible for use of the UW IRB; required type of IRB review; and identification of all applicable state and federal regulations.
  

  

**Consultation and training (10%)**
  

  

Provide direct consultation, education, and problem-solving through phone calls, in-person meetings, and classroom presentations to UW faculty, research staff, residents/fellows, and students about specific planned research and/or about human subjects research ethics, regulations, and review processes. May include assistance with developing ""review-ready"" applications and permission/assent/consent forms.

**Other duties as required (5%)**
  

  

Examples include: organizational effectiveness activities; participation in the development or revision of policies, procedures, and forms; training interactions with new HSD staff.


**Minimum Qualifications**
  

* Bachelor's degree in sciences, healthcare, communications, or art's & sciences and 4-5 years’ work experience
* Human subjects research review/oversight;
* Interaction with human subjects as a research staff person;
* Any position involving the application of complex regulatory systems to individuals and work activities;

Our AI-powered platform was purpose-built for medical conversations, improving clinical documentation efficiencies while enabling clinicians to focus on what matters most—their patients.


Our enterprise-grade technology transforms patient-clinician conversations into structured clinical notes in real-time, with deep EMR integrations. Powered by Linked Evidence and our purpose-built, auditable AI, we are the only company that maps AI-generated summaries to ground truth, helping providers quickly trust and verify the output. As pioneers in generative AI for healthcare, we are setting the industry standards for the responsible deployment of AI across health systems.


We are a growing team of practicing MDs, AI scientists, PhDs, creatives, technologists, and engineers working together to empower people and make care make more sense.

**The Role**
------------


From transcribing medical conversations to delivering key takeaways, our trailblazing work in machine learning research makes the Abridge experience possible. We're currently looking to hire research scientists with experience in machine learning and natural language processing. The ideal candidate will bring technical mastery, fluency with foundation models, genuine interest in the medical domain, and strong critical thinking skills to the role.

**Life at Abridge**
-------------------


At Abridge, we’re driven by our mission to bring understanding and follow-through to every medical conversation. Our culture is founded on doing things the “inverse” way in a legacy system—focusing on patients, instead of the system; focusing on outcomes, instead of billing; and focusing on the end-user experience, instead of a hospital administrator's mandate.


Abridgers are engineers, scientists, designers, and health policy experts from a diverse set of backgrounds—an experiment in alchemy that helps us transform an industry dominated by EHRs and enterprise into a consumer-driven experience, one recording at a time. We believe in strong ideas, loosely held, and place a high premium on a growth mindset. We push each other to grow and expose each other to the latest in our respective fields. Whether it’s holding a PhD-level deep dive into understanding fairness and underlying bias in machine learning models, debating the merits of a Scandinavian design philosophy in our UI/UX, or writing responses for Medicare rules to influence U.S. health policy, we prioritize sharing our findings across the team and helping each other be successful.

**Diversity & Inclusion**
-------------------------


Abridge is an equal opportunity employer. Diversity and inclusion is at the core of what we do. We actively welcome applicants from all backgrounds (including but not limited to race, gender, educational background, and sexual orientation).

About the Department  

The Cobey Lab is a computational lab that studies the interplay of immunity and the population dynamics of respiratory viruses such as influenza and SARS-CoV-2. We explore how immune responses arise after infection and vaccination and shape viral epidemiology and evolution. Our aim is to use this information to improve vaccination strategies. We are looking for quantitative Computational Research Scientists to work on multiple projects. Projects include (a) modeling the longitudinal dynamics of individual immune responses, (b) examining variability in individuals’ responses, and (c) improving methods to measure vaccine effectiveness. These projects involve close collaboration with epidemiologists, immunologists, ecologists, and evolutionary biologists, including through the NIH-funded Collaborative Influenza Vaccine Innovation Consortium (CIVIC), the Centers for Excellence in Influenza Research and Response (CEIRR), and other NIH-funded research projects. These positions offer substantial opportunities for intellectual creativity, collaboration, and leadership. Remote, U.S.-based work is an option. Salaries are competitive and based on experience. Potential applicants are encouraged to visit the lab’s website and to contact Dr. Cobey with questions.
