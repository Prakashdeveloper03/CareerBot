Constellaition is looking for a **Solution Architect**to join our **Anaplan** team in the **US**.

  

In this role, you will serve as the solution lead on our project team. Your role will be a highly client-facing one that involves eliciting robust requirements from clients, formulating that into a coherent design, leading a team to configure the solution, and working to deploy those solutions to a happy client. Depending on the size of the engagements, you may be placed on up to two projects simultaneously and will be charged with time management accordingly. You will be provided with training on core competencies in Constellaition's agile ASTRAL Methodology. It is expected that you are or will soon be a Certified Master Anaplanner.

At Constellaition, we expect our consultants to be well-rounded from a technical, functional, consultative, and collaborative perspective. At this point in your career, and looking at your career trajectory one and two levels up, you are a relatively new manager and leader and will focus on finding the authentic leadership traits within yourself.
