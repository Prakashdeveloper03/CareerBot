**About LIghtning Capital House Buyers**

For every 100 homes that are sold in United States about 5 of them do not follow the traditional “list it with a Realtor” route. The reasons for this are varied – property not inhabitable, estate property, property has not been remodeled in many years and is in poor condition, must sell fast, inherited property, tired landlord, crappy tenants, etc. The list goes on and on. These are motivated sellers with problem properties.

Believe it or not THOUSANDS homes and sellers have these issues in the US, and THOUSANDS homes are sold every year across the country that are not listed by a Realtor. Lightning Capital House Buyers mission is simple: create value for as many of these motivated sellers as possible by buying their home and helping them MOVE FORWARD to the next stage of their life.

Lightning Capital House Buyers was founded in 2017 in order to buy homes from these folks who don’t want to list with a Realtor. We are not Realtors. We are real estate investors. Since then we have bought, renovated, and sold over 200 homes in Tampa Bay. We’re pretty good at this business.

Today we have three lines of business:

We buy homes from motivated sellers and resell them to other investors.

We buy homes, renovate them, and resell them to retail buyers.

We buy homes for our rental portfolio.

**Our Mission**



To make recurring work fun, fast, and faultless for teams everywhere.


**Our Culture**



Process Street was founded on a strong belief in the work-life benefits of a healthy, collaborative, remote culture.

Spread across 9 different time zones, we communicate asynchronously, work autonomously, and take real ownership of our work. We know human connections are what make teams strong, so we regularly do coffee chats, game-playing, story-telling, and more to build strong relationships.



If you're entrepreneurial and seek an environment that values impact, ownership, and flexibility, we look forward to meeting you!


**The Opportunity**



As an Associate Account Executive at Process Street, you'll be responsible for closing new logos and expanding our relationship with existing customers.

* You adapt well, and you're a fast learner
* You're eager to help implement processes and improve our system


**Our Benefits**


* **Unlimited PTO policy** – Most take 3-4 weeks, plus their major holidays, AND a company-wide week off in December.
* **Annual company offsite** – We get together as a whole company to celebrate company milestones as well as encourage and sponsor small group meetups so that you can meet your teammates face-to-face around the world.
* **Social time** – We know human connections are what make teams strong. We regularly do coffee chats, game-playing, story-telling, house tours (only if you're comfortable), and more to build connections.
* **Generous health insurance** for US employees and their families.
* **Equity** for all full-time roles.


Confidence can sometimes hold us back from applying for a job. But we'll let you in on a secret: there's no such thing as a 'perfect' candidate. Process Street is a place where everyone can grow. So, however you identify and whatever background you bring with you, please apply if this is a role that would make you excited to come to work every day.

### **About Yelp**



Yelp was created to connect people with great local businesses. As an Inside Sales Representative (ISR), you'll be working directly with these local businesses to help them achieve their goals through Yelp's various advertising programs. You'll work with small business owners via phone to determine their needs and aspirations and customize every sale to help make those happen. We succeed when we help our clients grow their businesses.

  



Because people are at the center of everything we do, one of your main priorities is to educate business owners about the value of Yelp's advertising platform. In this role, you will be directly responsible for selling advertising space on Yelp to local businesses across the US and Canada. Success in this role is measured by hitting and exceeding monthly sales goals, consistently staying ahead of daily metrics, and handling rejection in stride. You'll experience all of this in a supportive virtual team environment with the added flexibility of a remote workspace.

  



We'd love to have you apply, even if you don't feel you meet every single requirement in this posting. At Yelp, we're looking for great people, not just those who simply check off all the boxes.

* Own and manage a pipeline of clients ranging from dentists to florists to restaurant owners- all organized in our CRM (Salesforce)
* Say goodbye to that dreaded commute! You and your team will work from the comfort of your home to sell advertising to small local businesses on a set Monday to Friday schedule.
* Become an expert in Yelp's advertising solutions, and adapt product recommendations quickly to suit client needs - asking probing questions and overcoming customer objections and rejection will be critical to your success.
* Achieve and consistently exceed monthly sales goals- strong work ethic and tenacity are key!
* Stay organized and manage your time effectively in order to complete your daily goals- you know that sales is a numbers game and you're here to win.

### **What We're Looking For in You**


* You have an appetite for learning! You're keen on turning training and feedback into action and continuous self-improvement- you don't take rejection personally.
* Multi-tasking is no biggie. You're confident in navigating between numerous tabs, multiple screens, and using video conferencing tools.
* You're savvy and can find your way around new tools and software (such as Google Suite & Salesforce).
* You're naturally curious and like to ask as many questions as it takes to find the answer.
* You're excited about being part of a team with colleagues from other states, and you find it just as easy to chat with your teammates during a virtual conference as an in-person meeting.
* You are committed to a high standard of integrity and being a teamplayer is important to you.
* You're an excellent listener, assertive, persistent, and persuasive - show us your grit!
* You are genuinely curious about people, local businesses, and possess the innate ability to inspire passion in others- you can't wait to show everyone the value of Yelp.
* You are adaptable and can think on your feet. When faced with new challenges, or tough conversations, failure simply isn't an option.

### **Requirements**
