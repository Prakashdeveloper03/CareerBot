(\\*However, management opportunities are available for those interested.)

**Who We Are:**

BooksTime is an ambitious, innovative accounting & bookkeeping startup founded in 2016 with operations in 5 countries. For more information, check out our website: bookstime.com.

**What You'll Do:**

**As a Senior Accountant, you'll:**

Set up services for new clients: You'll talk with them, understand their needs, and coordinate a team of international bookkeepers to get services up and running. Your role is to be a high-level accounting resource to the bookkeepers, help manage communication with the client (including managing their expectations), and generally build a personal relationship with the client.

Supervise ongoing services: After the set-up is done, you’ll supervise and support the bookkeepers as needed for the same clients.

As a growing, evolving startup, there will also be opportunities to take on different or more specialized roles. For example, if you’re interested, there could be versions of this role that involve:

* Only new service set-up
* Only ongoing supervision
* Industry-specific specialization
* Management
* And much more

**We're Looking for Someone Who Is:**

Experienced. Our ideal candidate has handled the accounting for multiple companies (either in-house in an accounting/bookkeeping firm). If you had any of the following titles, it’s a good sign: Controller, Finance Manager, Full Charge Bookkeeper, Director of Accounting, VP of Finance, CFO, Senior Accountant, etc. Management experience is valuable but not required. Candidates should also have hands-on experience working directly in QuickBooks.

Knowledgeable. Most folks in this role have degrees in accounting (or similar) though this isn't strictly required. Being a CPA and/or ProAdvisor would be a plus, and common for this role, but these aren’t required either.

Highly organized. This role is a high-speed juggling act. You need to juggle multiple clients with different services and coordinate the work of a diverse team of bookkeepers. This requires exceptional organizational and time management skills.

Great at building strong relationships. A key part of the role is to establish a personal rapport with the clients. More than just an accountant, the goal in this position is to become a trusted advisor. This takes a friendly, positive “people person”.

A great communicator. As the face of BooksTime to the client, you should have excellent professional communication skills. You will need to be perfectly fluent in English (written and spoken).

Tech-savvy. You will need to be adept with computers and good at figuring out new systems and tools. Excel expertise is preferred. QuickBooks Online or Desktop experience is required. Experience with other accounting software, such as Xero or NetSuite, is not required but would be helpful.

An adaptable, fast learner. Every client is unique in terms of personality, needs, software, etc., so each new client is a learning experience. We need someone who feels very comfortable diving in and figuring things out. If you are happiest maintaining a well-established process that someone else designed, this is NOT the ideal role for you. If you love looking for creative solutions to new problems all the time, you could be a perfect fit!

(Note: for more experienced candidates, a management-track version of this role is available. For less experienced candidates, a less senior version of the role is available. Please feel free to inquire for details about these other roles.)

**Why Join BooksTime:**

Friendly and Supportive Work Environment. We may be biased, but our team is the best! We promote a healthy work/life balance and everyone on the team is friendly, supportive and always willing to lend a helping hand. Internal, anonymous surveys are sent frequently, and the results are consistently extremely positive. People love working here!

Make History. We have big plans to disrupt the accounting and bookkeeping industry – and we’re off to a great start.

Work That Matters. Your work is critical to the success of our clients, and of BooksTime.

Flexible Hours. Part time and full time options available. Either way, most of your hours can be very flexible. (We just need a certain amount of availability during business hours, including at least some hours between approx. 9-11am Eastern on at least 3 weekdays. More details below.)

Growth Opportunities. BooksTime is expanding and we will need more people in management roles very soon. It’s likely that someone in this role could be promoted in a number of months, based on interest and ability.

Work That Stays Fresh. You’ll have 10-30 clients, including all sorts of industries, software, service needs, etc. That means ample opportunities to learn new things. Plus, given the pace of change at our growing startup, we can pretty much guarantee that you will never be bored.

Constant Improvement. One of our core values at BooksTime is Constant Improvement. We’re always pushing to do better, from thinking of new ways to ""wow"" our clients to discovering opportunities to make internal processes more efficient. Our goal is to become the #1 bookkeeping firm in the country -- and our relentless focus on Constant Improvement is what will get us there. We can't wait to hear your ideas about how we can do better. If you're looking for a role that gives you unlimited opportunities to make an impact -- you've found it!

**Other Details:**

Hours: Your clients are all over the US. Some of your colleagues work in European time zones. To ensure overlap with clients and colleagues, you should at least be available approx. 9-11am Eastern at least 3 weekdays. The rest of your hours can be more flexible.

Full-Time/Part-Time: Both options available. Full-time preferred. For part-time, a minimum of 30 hours/week is required.

Salary Range: Negotiable based on education and experience.

**Benefits include:**

* Health (QSEHRA reimbursement plan)
* Retirement
* Paid time off (starting at 20 days for full time employees)
* Tech reimbursements
* (Depending on part-time/full-time status and other factors, there may be eligibility restrictions in some cases.)

COVID-19 considerations: This position is, and always will be, 100% remote.

**DEI Statement**

*BooksTimers come from every background and walk of life. We don't just talk about DEI in the abstract. BooksTimers come from every background and walk of life. We don't just talk about DEI in the abstract. Our actual team (at every level) is a cross-section of the world. We're building a team that's inclusive of the planet's best accountants and entrepreneurs across categories of race, ethnicity, national origin, native language, age, gender, sexual orientation, religion, and more.*
