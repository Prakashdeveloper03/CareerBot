### **Before you Apply**

### **FMG (Agency Revolution) is a fast-growing, location-independent company. This means that you are not required to report to an office each day, but rather work remotely from the location(s) of your choice.**

**However, ideal candidates for this role must still be within a 60 minute drive to the Lehigh Valley, PA, area since we do have team days and other in-person events on a regular basis.**

**Also, please be sure that you include a cover letter or note showing why you’re interested in this role and how your experience matches the hiring criteria for this open position.**

### **Compensation** **This position pays $45,000-$50,000 based on your experience level and expertise.**

Ultimately, your job is to maintain Agency Revolution's reputation and the client experience we’re known for through education, technical troubleshooting, and collaboration.

### **Primary Responsibilities & Expectations**

* Manage AMS sync during the Fuse onboarding process in collaboration with our onboarding Project Managers. You would be responsible for correctly connecting the AMS, ensuring that the segments meet the client goals and audiences are correct, and handling employee & policy mapping.

* Handle escalations for Fuse bugs and Fuse questions by serving as a liaison between AR Operations and other internal teams like Product and Engineering. A big part of your role will be continually identifying efficiencies with how escalations are reported and supported.
* Track Fuse bugs, process improvements, and questions that must be documented and shared with the team.
* Coordinate list migration from one AMS to another. You’ll be the default practitioner when clients change their AMS post-launch.
* Work with AR Operations Leadership on ongoing internal and client product training to ensure we’re always highlighting the value of Fuse. You’ll also be responsible for training the team on product updates or new releases by the Product Team.
* Track product feature requests using Canny.
