Committed to bridging gaps in GI health management, we leverage technological innovations to make early and non-invasive health screening accessible and actionable for individuals across India. As a self-funded organisation collaborating with innovative healthcare companies, we are at the forefront of driving change in the healthcare sector.

We specialise in introducing cutting-edge medical technologies, ranging from point-of-care monoclonal antibody-based rapid tests to device-based studies like Electrogastrography (EGG), at the forefront of gastroenterology.

As a pioneering leader in Gastroenterology diagnostics, GastroLab India offers an exciting opportunity for a Clinical Application Intern to join our dynamic team.

**Position Overview:**

We seek a dynamic and motivated individual to join our team as a Clinical Application Intern for our state-of-the-art GI physiology lab assays. This is a unique , offering a development plan to progress towards becoming a Clinical Application Specialist. The ladder leads to exciting leadership levels, including Senior Clinical Sales Specialist, Senior VP, and Senior Director.

As a Clinical Application Intern, you will play a crucial role in demonstrating the utility of current and upcoming test technologies within GastroLab India’s portfolio. The role involves hands-on experience with novel diagnostic testing technologies, conducting EGG studies, and contributing to clinical analysis of real-world data generated at multiple sites.

As an intern in clinical application, your role is based on three pillars. The first pillar involves demonstrating the utility of current and future upcoming test technologies as part of GastroLab India’s portfolio. These technologies range from point-of-care monoclonal antibody-based rapid tests, ELISA and turbidimetry-based markers, LAMP PCR and device-based studies like Electrogastrography (EGG).

It is crucial to disseminate the appropriate knowledge about these novel technologies as they have a steep learning curve for users, particularly for clinicians in the field of gastroenterology. This is a very niche medicine segment, with only a few specialists in any part of the country. For example, there are at most 120 medical gastroenterologists in Delhi NCR. We aim to enable GastroLab’s Gi Physiology and Motility Diagnostic Lab with these gastroenterologists in their existing endoscopy suites. This is only possible if we can share the evidence behind the clinical utility of these novel diagnostic testing technologies.

None of the tests we work with are me-too medical devices. Each 10+ and growing range of medical devices we work with is the first of their kind. In most cases, we have absolute market leadership and are exclusive scientific partners for the inventors of these test technologies from various parts of the globe.

The technology at the heart of this profile is Electrogastrography (EGG), which has the same potential as ECG for the cardiology domain. Therefore, one of the critical responsibilities of the Clinical Application intern would be to perform the EGG studies on the enrolled patients across the selected Gi centres of excellence. This would involve interacting with the patients and clinicians to discuss the patient’s EGG study outcomes.

Regarding this aspect of the role, there are two strengths that the individual will learn to embrace. The first is to make themselves available at multiple sites within their base city and major cities in the neighbourhood. The benefit of this is being able to interact and learn from clinicians who are considered key opinion leaders in their domains and gain hands-on experience of what the real-world patient journey looks like for clinicians.

This insight will empower them to map this patient journey and provide solutions to diagnose diseases that are not only difficult to diagnose but also equally difficult to treat. Your hard work will be rewarded by being the one who can offer insights into not just the appropriate diagnosis of debilitating diseases like Gastroparesis but also suggest whether the possible cure would be achievable from a therapeutic or surgical intervention.

The second pillar of this profile relies on clinical analysis of the real-world data generated at multiple sites. The strength to be embraced from this aspect is working with the end goal in mind. Awareness that each enrolled patient will represent a different clinical phenotype and each data point is crucial to the outcome's success. This real-world data in most clinical settings never gets to see the daylight due to the non-existent priorities of publishing real-world data. This is something you will get to address and be the change agent.

The testament to our unwavering focus on ensuring our collaborated projects impact actual patient care is that the last concluded Indian Society of Gastroenterology Annual Congress had three poster presentations, two of which won the first and the third prize.

The third aspect of this profile entails acquiring market intelligence. Our primary objective is to identify the unfulfilled need for better diagnostic tools pertinent to Indian disease epidemiology. The portfolio of GastroLab India facilitates a fundamental change in GI disease diagnostics and unveils future disease implications beyond the GI tract. The candidate on this profile would be expected to contribute towards this cause.

A typical day for an intern at our institution would involve conducting EGG studies at Apollo Hospital on Monday and discussing the report outcomes with the gastroenterologists. On Tuesday, the studies may take place at Fortis Hospital, and on Wednesday, the intern may travel to Jaipur to present the scientific deck to an eminent gastroenterologist at a premier centre of excellence.
