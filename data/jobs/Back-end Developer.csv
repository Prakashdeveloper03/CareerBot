We are a systems engineering team with members from a variety of professional backgrounds who are united in a quest to deliver enterprise-class solutions to our clients. This includes building scalable, secure, consumer-facing web and mobile apps for a variety of audiences and business needs.

Our process is simple – we work in close collaboration with our clients to create solutions that address their unique challenges. We work with our clients, not as an implementation vendor, but as a strategic partner. We seek to understand their needs, call upon our unique experiences and prescribe solutions that address their strategic goals.

**What We’re Looking For**  
You engineer systems. You understand that complexity is easy and simplicity is hard - and chose to do the hard things. Clean and efficient code is important to you. You want to build things that have meaning and take on big challenges.

You see the whole picture. You know how to architect systems - and that systems are more than just technical requirements. You understand how to build people, solutions, and engage with clients. You have led a team to accomplish more than it's individual contributors.

You understand the responsibility that comes with building consumer facing applications – either as part of a team team or by yourself - and are excited by the opportunity to create systems that consumers use and depend on.

You understand software development, not just tool xyz or framework foo. Your experience extends into many tools and frameworks and are always experimenting with the latest tech to see how it can help you solve new problems. While you have a wide range of exposure to frameworks and tools, once you find The (latest) One, you dive in and become an expert.

You think in terms of scale. Once you make it work, you think about how it'll work at scale: what happens when there are 100 users? 10,000 users? 1,000,000 users? Make it work, make it right.

You pay attention. Pick one of the previous eight what we're looking for points that you most relate to and list it in your resume or cover letter to know that you actually read this.

**Preferred Experience**  
Experience consulting with clients - either on the side or as a part of your job responsibilities.

Gramercy Consultants, LLC (“Gramercy Tech”) is an award winning digital agency that was born out of the need to bring digital experiences to live events. We specialize in everything from concept creation, design, and software development to event management, credentialing and access control. Our team members are passionate about innovation, collaboration, and supporting one another. We are constantly striving to improve our platform and ourselves so that we can better support our clients.

Gramercy Tech is proud to be recognized by Clutch in their 2019 report as one of the top UX designers in New York and by Manifest as one of the top 25 IT services companies in New York. Additionally, we secured a spot on the Leader’s Matrix as a proven market leader and the top 8th UX consulting firm in New York City.

Our team is looking for a **Freelance Front End Developer** with extensive CSS and Javascript/jQuery experience that can help us manage and create content within our proprietary event CMS / platform, Eventfinity. The ideal candidate is passionate about design / UI / UX, is quick on their feet, has experience customizing content from top to bottom - especially within third party environments (think Squarespace, Weebly, Shopify, etc), and enjoys working in a fast paced environment.

This is not a traditional front end role -- the majority of work will be manipulating content in an existing structure/template, and implementing creative solutions utilizing Javascript/jQuery and CSS to accommodate client requests for customization. Experience working with a legacy codebase and existing within the confines of that environment is helpful.

The Eventfinity platform powers hybrid virtual events (e.g. agendas, video content, attendee directories, networking, chat rooms), as well as badge printing and mobile apps for in-person events. Front end developer responsibilities include working with project managers, clients, and the design team to bring events to life on the front end by editing plug-ins and client facing app code, strategizing around ways to use existing functionality to achieve client requests, or writing custom CSS and JS/jQuery to manipulate the current CMS functionalities and customize platform functionality. Candidates should have an eye for design and be well versed in JS / jQuery, CSS, and HTML.

Although the main focus of this role is almost entirely on the front-end side, there is always the possibility of growth; so knowledge of Vue, PHP, and Laravel is considered an important plus in order to facilitate communication between the front-end team and the back-end programmers who manage the development of the Eventfinity platform.

**Qualifications:**

* 2 or more years experience showing proficiency with front-end technologies, including HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and jQuery
* Experience building websites / microsites without relying on external frameworks is a huge plus, as you will be writing your own CSS / JS / HTML from scratch
* Familiarity with Ajax and asynchronous / dynamic content
* Experience creating complex mobile-first, responsive websites / microsites
* Solid understanding of cross browser/device responsive development
* Background in design / having a good eye for design, ability to pick up where mockups leave off
* Ability to manipulate the DOM while working within the confines of a CMS (Squarespace, Shopify, Weebly, etc)
* Experience utilizing Bootstrap framework
* Experience theming content within an existing platform; able to build a theme from the ground up, able to skin or build out a simple plugin, able to use a code editor to build complex JS/jQuery that will work within the platform, able to create readable and concise CSS
* Good understanding of ADA/WCAG compliance for an accessible web
* Experience debugging in the browser
* Understanding semantic structure and best JS / CSS practices to maintain optimization (understanding of caching/minification, image optimization, etc.)
* Strong communication / interpersonal skills, able to form productive working relationships while working remotely
* Ability to manage time and expectations while juggling multiple projects with different teams
* Excels under pressure and working with hard deadlines

### **About Us**


Since 1945, U-Haul has been serving do-it-yourself movers and their households. Like many other successful ventures, the concept for U-Haul was generated out of need. After World War II, there existed the widespread need for do-it-yourself moving equipment that would be available on a one-way, nationwide basis.


U-Haul co-founders L.S. ""Sam"" Shoen and his wife, Anna Mary Carty Shoen, recognized that need and acted upon it. Their visionary approach spread the cost of ownership among many users, facilitating the mobility of the populations of the U.S. and Canada. The covered wagon of the pioneers morphed into orange U-Haul trailers. In the process, an industry was born.


U-Haul Holding Company and its family of companies, including U-Haul, have strived to create a culture of health and wellness. As of February 1, 2020, and consistent with applicable law, no U-Haul Holding Company or its family of companies will hire individuals in states where it may lawfully decline to hire individuals who use nicotine products (Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia and Washington). This policy will not apply to team members hired before February 1, 2020."

Our team is fully remote and we’ll consider overseas applicants if the timezone is reasonably similar to GMT (within 2 hours).



We’re looking for a developer with design sensibilities. A digital designer who is also a self-taught coder, or a dev with interest in the design industry would fit right in. Any gaps in dev experience can be taught (we do front- and back-end simultaneously, for example) but a design-led approach and organised working process is crucial.



As a Developer at Cliff Studio you will work with a small and fully remote team, collaborating closely with our director / developer on beautiful, robust websites.

* Recommend interactions, behaviours and scroll effects to suit projects
* Keep up with industry trends, technology and creative benchmarks to ensure our websites always feel exciting and fresh


The Requirements:


* 3+ years experience as a WordPress developer with links to previous work
* Complete fluency in HTML, CSS, PHP, jQuery, Javascript and SASS
* Exceptional eye for detail – our faithful replications of designs are always commented upon!
* Projects usually overlap and we have a fast-paced schedule, so someone with the ability to work quickly and efficiently will fit in perfectly
* Self-motivated and able to work effectively on a remote basis
* Experience in Figma and Adobe Creative Cloud would be useful but can be taught
* Willing to learn and adapt to new trends and tools
* Some design experience would be useful but not essential – interest in graphic design is important, though!

* Work fully remotely

Information asymmetry has led to social inequality, scandals, polarization, and corruption. Sometimes, it has even led to war. Centralized data control acts as a potential chokepoint for innovation, raises privacy concerns, and creates a bottleneck for the free flow of data.



Openmesh is a cutting-edge new open-source cloud infrastructure and a global open data network aimed at storing important global data without a middleman. It is the largest open web3 data lake, covering approximately 80% of the entire crypto and web3 ecosystem today. In 2023 and 2024, we aim to expand our data coverage to include public health and scientific research data.



Openmesh enables anyone to create their own decentralized data cloud, connect globally, share data securely, slash deployment costs, and automate data cloud setup. The Openmesh Network is designed to collect, store, process, stream, and provide data connectivity for anyone, anywhere, anytime, without the need for registration, licensing, or payments. Think of Openmesh as the internet's open data fabric. It grants universal access and prevents interferences created by regulators, governments, corporations, and even its own creators. The possibilities are endless.


**Core Products**



Our flagship product, Xnode, is an integral part of this vision, offering a revolutionary platform for developers to build decentralized data clouds. Xnode, enables developers to build their own decentralized data clouds with data connectivity, data APIs, and query & analytics engines in mere minutes, instead of weeks or months. They pay only for computing and storage, sidestepping licensing and setup fees. Xnode facilitates a 10-15 fold cost reduction in running and operating data clouds and can save over 95% of deployment time.



Pythia is a powerhouse analytics & query engine that transforms raw data into actionable insights. Pythia allows anyone to design, build, visualize, and deploy powerful data products.



Unified APIs provide a single endpoint for all crypto & web3 data, making it accessible to anyone, anywhere, without any costs. There are no licenses, registrations, or setup fees involved.


**Our vision**



Our vision is to democratize data and address information asymmetry at a scale. Data & information is the most valuable commodity in the world. Without quality, reliable data, all webpages, apps, and the entire internet will stop working. We believe access to reliable, unedited information is a fundamental right- an aspect of a free and democratic society. The Core Principles of Openmesh, by design, has no single authority that can alter its data, how the information is distributed or controlled, or who can see what and when. The infrastructure and entire technology stack is open-source and governed by an open-source community.

At Files.com, we build technology so businesses can manage file transfer and security at scale. We are private equity backed, profitable, and lead our industry in terms of revenue per employee. This means that each and every team member is able to have a high degree of direct responsibility and impact.



We are a SaaS, Cloud-Based Managed File Transfer platform that enables organizations to securely transfer, share, and store files between users, teams, and organizations. Our app and API is primarily written in Ruby on Rails (though we built our own internal framework for APIs, not ActionController, and we don't use Rails views at all). We have additional backend services written in Ruby, have built our own version of Resque, and heavily use things like Redis and Elasticsearch.



We are looking for seasoned Back End Ruby Engineers with strong backgrounds in data structures, algorithms, and scaling to join our team and help us build features into our already great app.


**World Class Pay and Benefits**



Earn a ""Bay Area"" Salary from Anywhere. Our pay is competitive with the top software companies in the world, with generous base salary plus equity compensation.


**Big Company Benefits**



You'll get full Health/Dental/Vision Insurance coverage (plus 75% of Spouse/Family coverage too), 401(k) with generous matching, 11 Company Holidays per year, and 20 PTO/Vacation days, plus we give employees off for Winter Break at the end of the year!

**100% Remote Opportunity**



The Files.com Engineering team is 100% remote. However, we travel for regular in-person meetings with the team and the entire company to meet and work together face to face. These meetings are in cities around the US, including Scottsdale, Austin, Orlando, New Orleans, San Diego, Las Vegas, and New York City.



In-person events combine work and fun and are designed to make up for the in-person interaction that occurs in an office job.


**About the Role**



As a Back End Ruby Engineer at Files.com, you will take the lead on helping build cutting edge features into the Files.com product that drive value for the 4,000 businesses that use our platform. Our API receives hundreds of requests per second and is used by both internal and external developers. Here are some examples of projects that our Developers have recently completed:



Implementing Single-Sign-On via OAuth, SAML, and SCIM.



Building a scalable engine that can convert nearly any type of files to PDF for in-browser previews (like the former Crocodoc service).



Upgrading our API documentation to be automatically generated using the OpenAPI standard, and the creation of automatically-generated SDKs.



Building our Universal Sync engine, which is a tool that allows Files.com users to synchronize their files to other cloud services such as S3, Azure, and Rackspace.



And here are some examples of projects that our Developers will be tackling in the next 6-12 months:



Implementing in-file search using Elasticsearch with custom input filters to index a plethora of document types.
Building a file versioning tool that uses Git behind the scenes to give customers easy tracking of file versions.
Additionally, you'll contribute to our ongoing projects for improving security, monitoring, and performance.

	+ With 5 offices worldwide and teams spread throughout the US, EMEA and Philippines, our multicultural teams work cross-departmentally and across continents and cultures towards a shared goal.
	+ We offer a diverse environment that promotes DEI efforts, values multiple perspectives and fresh thinking and which includes Aprimo HELPS, an employee resource group (ERG) that is dedicated to giving back to our local communities.
* Through its relaxed environment, Aprimo embodies a more casual “Silicon Valley” atmosphere.

	+ As such, individual team members can leave a lasting impact and footprint within the organization – in fact, our average employee tenure is 7.7 years.
* Aprimo employs a “choose your own adventure” approach to career advancement.
	+ Staff members are not siloed into roles and for many of our teams there is no set ladder that one needs to climb to achieve growth and promotion.
	+ Rather, we emphasize an organic approach to career development in which employees can and do frequently transition into newly created roles within their own teams or transition into other departments based on their interests in exploring new skills and responsibilities.
	+ For additional learning and development, we recently rolled out Udemy, which is an online learning platform that employees have access to and which features over 200,000 courses on a wide variety of business topics.

Full Stack Developer**

**What’s the story?** 

In India, there are more than 453+ million migrants. Less than 2% of this cohort uses mobile payments to send money home. While penetration of UPI and digital banking hit the ceiling, this invisible workforce that powers most of Bharat is still stuck in a cash economy and remains underbanked. **branchX is India's first neobank enabling empathetic banking for migrant communities.** Building banking that is meaningfully accessible to every aspiring Indian goes beyond the 9-5 bustle. If you are someone who derives fulfillment from purpose-led work with the ability to experiment, innovate, fail and iterate, branchX is the playground for you.

**Location: Bangalore**

**About Us:**

Launched in June 2020, branchX is India's first neo-banking solution, enabling empathetic banking for migrant communities. Our vision is to transform the way underbanked communities manage money with a ‘hand-holding grid’ aided by intelligent technologies. Headquartered in Navi-Mumbai, we are a 100+ member impact-driven team with offices in Noida, Bangalore, Kochi, Tamil Nadu, Kolkata and other locations.

**Where do you come into the picture?** 

A highly motivated and experienced Full Stack Developer who will produce scalable software solutions. The individual should be comfortable with both front-end and back-end coding languages, development frameworks, and third-party libraries.

**What would a day in your life @ branchX look like?** 

* Work with development teams and product managers to ideate software solutions
* Design client-side and server-side architecture
* Build the front-end of applications through appealing visual design
* Develop and manage well-functioning databases and applications
* Write effective APIs
* Test software to ensure responsiveness and efficiency
* Troubleshoot, debug and upgrade software
* Create security and data protection settings
* Build features and applications with a mobile responsive design
* Write technical documentation
* Work with data scientists and analysts to improve software

**Desirables:**

* Proven experience of 4-5 years as a Full Stack Developer.
* Should be excellent in Python and PHP.
* Experience developing desktop and mobile applications.
* Familiarity with common stacks
* Knowledge of multiple front-end languages and libraries (e.g. HTML/ CSS, JavaScript, XML, jQuery)
* Knowledge of multiple back-end languages (e.g. C#, Java, Python) and JavaScript frameworks (e.g. Angular, React, Node.js)
* Familiarity with databases (e.g. MySQL, MongoDB), web servers (e.g. Apache), and UI/UX design
* Excellent communication and teamwork skills.
* Organizational skills
* Degree in Computer Science, Statistics or a relevant field.

**What expertise & experiences would you need to have to play this kind of role?** 

A strong leader who can adapt to cross-functional teams that are responsible for the full software development life cycle, from conception to deployment.

**Core Value** 

‘Empathy’ as a term has become a buzzword. At branchX, we are constantly reimagining what empathy means in action. While we are finding new ways of translating empathy at work and on the ground, we do know that it goes beyond the extension of feeling 'something' for an individual. We are combining empathy and action to uplift underbanked communities. What does this mean for you? It means you’ll be part of co-creating products for the masses. Products that are meaningfully accessed by the underserved and will directly boost India’s economy in the long term. If indulging in blue-sky thinking, innovating, and iterating to create grassroots impact makes you tickle.
