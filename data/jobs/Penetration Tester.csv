Job Description


Position Overview:


At Experian, we recognize the need for vigilant cybersecurity to safeguard our systems and data. As such, we are seeking a Penetration Tester to fortify our defenses and ensure our digital assets remain secure.


Role Definition:


The Penetration Tester is an essential part of our cybersecurity team, responsible for identifying vulnerabilities within our digital infrastructure. By simulating cyber-attacks and assessing our systems, this role plays a fundamental part in highlighting potential security threats and strengthening our defenses.


Scope of Work:

* Infrastructure Assessment: The Penetration Tester will analyze a variety of systems within Experian, spanning from external-facing applications to internal networks or cloud environments, ensuring all potential vectors of attack are considered.
* Regular Deliverables: Meeting targets is crucial. Delivering a minimum workload per month is a clear metric of productivity, yet it's vital this doesn't come at the expense of the assessment's depth or quality.
* Strategic Testing: Under the guidance of senior team members, the Penetration Tester will work to determine which systems to test, based on current risk assessments and business needs.
* Standards Adherence: While conducting tests, it's essential to follow industry best practices and our in-house SOPs, ensuring consistent and rigorous assessments.
* Skill Development: Continual learning is encouraged. While proficiency in basic scripting and understanding of various environments is required, there will be opportunities to expand on these skills and learn new techniques.
* Clear Communication: The ability to relay findings, both to the cybersecurity team and potentially to broader stakeholders, is essential. Clear, concise reporting ensures swift action can be taken on any vulnerabilities found.
* Team Collaboration: Being a valuable team player is vital. While the Penetration Tester will work on individual projects, collaboration, sharing insights, and integrating feedback are all crucial aspects of the role.


Value Proposition:


The Penetration Tester, while being an individual contributor, is a foundational pillar in Experian's overarching cybersecurity strategy. This role ensures our systems are resilient against potential threats and provides peace of mind that our digital operations can continue unhindered by external threats.


Roles and Responsibilities:

* Deliver above the minimum required workload per month without compromising on the quality of assessment.
* Deliver penetration tests on both business-critical applications and infrastructure to support the organization’s information security risk management program.
* Ensure tests are prioritized based on business and compliance requirements, such as compliance due date, requested date and feedback from the application team.
* Guarantee engagements are fully compliant of our standard operating procedures and service level agreement timelines.
* Proficient at scripting and automating exploits in language of choice
* Make consistent efforts to upskill and learn new testing standards.
* Understand and clearly communicate potential vulnerabilities and their associated risk level, remediation steps and/or mitigating controls with business stakeholders.
* Research and maintain proficiency in tools, techniques, countermeasures, and trends in computer and network vulnerabilities, data hiding and encryption.
* Participate in regular Teach-the-team sessions to share the knowledge with team members.
* Complete assigned training and certification per agreed timeline
* Attend and contribute during engagement’s scoping calls.

  

**Qualifications**  

Qualifications:

* 2+ years' experience in a Penetration Testing position
* Experience in planning and executing penetration tests/red team exercises against web applications, containers, APIs, network devices, databases, operating systems, and various cloud technologies.
* Infrastructure penetration testing while most of the time focused on assessing cloud environments, both public and private ones.
* Preferred certifications are listed as follows OSWA, OSCP, CPSA, CWAT, Pen Test+, CPENT, GPEN, AWS Security Specialty or similar certifications.
