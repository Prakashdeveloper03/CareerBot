**Solutions Architect**

***(This position is hybrid and required to work 2 days a week in the Denton Texas Support Center)***


Our commitments are to build a truly diverse and inclusive company, care for our customers, people, and planet, and outperform together.

**Essential Function**


The solutions architect is accountable for proactively and holistically leading or supporting EA activities for creating deliverables that guide the developing direction for managing a portfolio of solutions in response to disruptive forces, and driving achieving targeted business outcomes. Solutions include systems (including applications, technologies, processes and information), shared infrastructure services and shared application services.


Solutions architects provide the necessary leadership, analysis and design tasks related to the development of an enterprise's solutions architecture. This individual creates deliverables that help develop a direction for managing the organization's portfolio of ""to be"" and ""as is"" solutions — including systems (meaning not just applications, but also processes and information), shared infrastructure services, and shared application services and components to better match targeted business outcome objectives. Solutions architecture is sometimes used interchangeably with applications and infrastructure architecture. However, both aforementioned typically fall under the purview of the solutions architect.


Application architecture is a subset of solutions architecture. It's the discipline that guides application design and defines application architecture paradigms, such as service-oriented architecture (SOA), principles that influence design decisions and patterns that provide proven design solutions.


Solutions architects leverage and use technology solutions to enable the organization's future-state business capabilities that, in turn, drive the organization's targeted outcomes. They facilitate and orchestrate the delivery of targeted business outcomes.

**Primary Duties**

* Understand business drivers and business capabilities (future and current state), and determine corresponding enterprise system designs and change requirements to drive the organization's targeted business outcomes.
* Design and lead the implementation of a solutions architecture across a group of specific business applications or technologies based on enterprise business strategy, business capabilities and business requirements.
* Manage and develop the architecture for a broader scope of projects, working closely with application architects that manage and design architecture for a single project or initiative.
* Provide consulting support to application architects within projects to ensure the project is aligned with the overall enterprise architecture.
* Monitor the current-state solution portfolio to identify deficiencies through aging of the technologies used by the application, or misalignment with business requirements.
* Understand technology trends and the practical application of existing, new, and emerging technologies to enable new and evolving business and operating models.
* Understand, advocate and augment the principles of information technology strategies.
* Analyze the business-IT environment (run, grow and transform the business) to detect critical deficiencies, and recommend solutions for improvement (systems of record, differentiation and innovation).
* Analyze the technology industry, competitors and market trends, and determine their potential impact on the enterprise.
* Define the principles, guidelines, standards and solution patterns to ensure solution decisions are aligned with the enterprise's future-state architecture vision.
* Design and direct the governance activities associated with ensuring solutions architecture assurance and compliance.
* Develop a roadmap for the evolution of the enterprise application portfolio from future to current state (as defined by the solutions architecture).

This position is remote.



**Leadership Skills & Behaviors:**


* **Strategic Thinking**– Knack for sorting through clutter to find the best route, often by pulling up from the current complexity to identify patterns that guide future direction and allow one to narrow the options and articulate the options from which others can work backward.
* **Business Acumen** – A keenness and quickness in understanding and dealing with a business situation (risks and opportunities) in a manner that is likely to lead to a good outcome. Critical to this is an ability to think beyond their own function.
* **Systems/Analytical Thinking** – Demonstrates the ability to think fluidly and integrate information. Able to anticipate non-linear and non-obvious relationships. Often includes an ability to think holistically/conceptually – very powerful when accompanied by ability to communicate & clarify tactically.
* **Flexibility/Working through Ambiguity** – Tendency to be energized by new experiences/perspectives that test assumptions and thinking. Considers different points of view, sometimes with fragmented information, to arrive at practical, effective, actionable next steps.
* **Communicate** – Managers discuss the company's vision and strategies, the department's direction and goals, and in times of crisis, what we know and don't know to make sure team members know what they need to know.
* **Clarify** – As managers, it's up to us to clarify what good looks like. What do we expect? What do our clients, customers or colleagues need? If our teams are not performing as expected, managers must clarify expectations and ensure understanding.
* **Coach** – Managers provide recognition and feedback; help team members find solutions to challenges; amplify good and filter weaker aspects of organizational culture and the work as they coach employees in their day-to-day performance and their growth and career development.
* **Connect** – Managers help our teams see their collective purpose and how their work connects to the greater whole. We connect people within our company and network.
* **Customize** – As managers, we need to understand what makes each team member unique, and then customize, tailor and adapt how we support them.


**Centivo Values:**


* **Resilient** – This is wicked hard. There is no easy button for healthcare affordability. Luckily, the mission makes it worth it and sustains us when things are tough. Being **resilient** ensures we don't give up.
* **Uncommon** - The status quo stinks so we had to go out and build something better. We know the healthcare system. It isn't working for members, employers, and providers. So we're building it from scratch, from the ground up. Our focus is on making things better for them while also improving clinical results - which is bold and **uncommon**.
* **Positive** – We care about each other. It takes energy to do hard stuff, build something better and to be resilient and unconventional while doing it. Because of that, we make sure we give kudos freely and feedback with care. When our tank gets low, a team member is there to be a source of new energy. We celebrate together. We are supportive, generous, humble, and **positive**.

**Pay Transparency**  

The ranges we place in our job postings reflect what we anticipate to be the minimum to maximum of the base salary for this role. Additionally, our overall benefits package includes a few things you may consider towards a total compensation such as bonus, health benefits (some employer paid), PTO, and equity option grants.

Your Role and Responsibilities  

**Who you are:**  

We are IBM ZOS (Z Operating System) - IBM Z Network Configuration Assistant Product team working on Z Enterprise Systems and we build the most secure systems for our Banking and Enterprise customers to deploy their mission critical applications. Also, We provide atmost security and Data management on Z systems. The mission critical applications run on zOS and The IBM® Configuration Assistant for z/OS® Communications Server, an optional GUI-based tool, provides a guided interface for configuring TCP/IP policy-based networking functions. You can use the IBM Configuration Assistant for z/OS Communications Server to generate the Policy Agent files.  

  

The IBM Configuration Assistant for z/OS Communications Server is a z/OS Management Facility (z/OSMF) task. z/OSMF provides a web browser interface for a variety of z/OS system management functions. When you invoke the IBM Configuration Assistant for z/OS Communications Server in z/OSMF, the IBM Configuration Assistant for z/OS Communications Server runs natively in the z/OS system and you can access it through a web browser.  

  

Through a series of wizards and online help panels, you can use the IBM Configuration Assistant for z/OS Communications Server to create AT-TLS configuration files for any number of z/OS images with any number of TCP/IP stacks per image. Using the IBM Configuration Assistant for z/OS Communications Server, there are three types of reusable objects:  

  

Traffic descriptors that define the local application, by describing the TCP traffic with ports or identifying the application using its jobname.  

Security levels that define the different ways to protect data, such as the encryption level.  

Requirement maps that map traffic descriptors to security levels. A single requirement map should contain a complete set of security requirements that will govern the level of security for multiple IP traffic types.  

  

For each TCP/IP stack, you create a set of connectivity rules that indicate the data endpoints and indicate which requirement map will govern security between the data endpoints.  

  

The IBM Configuration Assistant for z/OS Communications Server comes with a number of IBM-supplied traffic descriptors, security levels, and requirement maps that are easily applied, or you can use the IBM-supplied definitions as the basis for your own set of reusable objects.  

  

The IBM Configuration Assistant for z/OS Communications Server can dramatically reduce the amount of time that is required to create AT-TLS policy files, contributing to ease of configuration and maintenance. Because of the inherently complex nature of z/OS security, using the GUI can help you ensure that you have a consistent and easily manageable interface for implementing AT-TLS security.

==================



Today, there's more data and users outside the enterprise than inside, causing the network perimeter as we know it to dissolve. We realized a new perimeter was needed, one that is built in the cloud and follows and protects data wherever it goes, so we started Netskope to redefine Cloud, Network and Data Security.



Since 2012, we have built the market-leading cloud security company and an award-winning culture powered by hundreds of employees spread across offices in Santa Clara, St. Louis, Bangalore, London, Melbourne, Taipei, and Tokyo. Our core values are openness, honesty, and transparency, and we purposely developed our open desk layouts and large meeting spaces to support and promote partnerships, collaboration, and teamwork. From catered lunches and office celebrations to employee recognition events (pre and hopefully post-Covid) and social professional groups such as the Awesome Women of Netskope (AWON), we strive to keep work fun, supportive and interactive.
