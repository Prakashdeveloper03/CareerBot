**About Harvest Wealth Group**



Harvest Wealth Group is a top-performing financial planning firm based in Exeter, CA, managing over $350 million in assets.



We have embraced the Diamond Team model, a revolutionary way of organizing advisory firms. Like a baseball diamond, our Diamond Teams consist of a senior advisor on second base, lead advisors on first and third bases, and an associate advisor on home plate. This structure fosters collaboration, specialization, and career progression, enabling us to deliver exceptional service to our clients while ensuring advisor success and firm growth.



Our purpose is to create a massive impact in the lives of our team and clients by delivering quality, actionable financial advice to the hard-working American family because that is what we are, and that is who we care about.



We all work together to serve and impact 4000 families by 2023.



Our clients are 40- to 60-year-old family stewards with at least $400,000 to invest that live in the communities we serve; they are financially phobic and looking for a trusted “who” to outsource this part of their life completely. If you have experience working with this type of client – or want that experience – this role will be a great fit.

  


You will love it here if these core values are who you naturally and authentically are:


* **Scrappy -** We choose a fighting spirit to relentlessly push through challenges and obstacles smarter, faster, and against all odds.
* **Obsessively Serve -** We commit and exist to proactively serve our team and clients, so their concerns are always at the forefront of our business. We will serve our team and clients with a genuine humility that leaves no doubt they are valued as people. We will go the second mile!
* **Stronger United -** We check our egos at the door! The positive spirit with which we support each other fosters authentic, respectful, and meaningful relationships. We celebrate and embrace our differences. We invest in each other because we win or lose as a team.
* **Excellence Wins -** We are committed to continually striving to improve and innovate ourselves and our business. We are here to delight, meet and exceed our team's and client's highest expectations in everything we do. This gives us the edge.


As a Virtual Associate Advisor within our Diamond Team model, you will play a crucial role in serving our clients and driving the growth of our firm. You will work closely with the team, leveraging the support and expertise available to build deep relationships.



You’ll love coming to work every day if you get, want, and have the capacity to:

**ABOUT THE DIAMOND TEAM:**

  


Diamond Teams facilitate the growth of advisory and wealth management firms by accelerating the training and knowledge of advisors at every level. They enhance the productivity and proficiency of financial advisors while amplifying the revenue, profit, and enterprise value of the advisory firm. Each team is accountable for a group of the firm's clients, or all of them in smaller firms.


* In Diamond Teams, the Senior Advisor is responsible for the top 20% of the Team's essential clients, devoting the rest of their time to bringing in new clients and/or managing the firm. The majority of the team's clients are then divided between the two Lead Advisors (sometimes called Service Advisors), who handle client meetings and provide investment management, financial planning, and other services. The Lead Advisors also focus on bringing new clients to the firm.
* The Associate Advisor supports the Lead Advisors by sitting in client meetings, taking notes, and learning how the firm's lead advisors work directly with clients. They also help with investment screening and monitoring, drafting financial plans, and administrative duties. As firms expand, one of the Lead Advisors forms another Team, while the Associate Advisor takes over their role. A new associate is hired, and the training process starts again. The Lead Advisor would be promoted to the Senior Advisor role upon the retirement or transition of the current Senior Advisor to a firm management role."

You will manage the team, supervise the setup and execution of events, handle budgets, and communicate with clients to ensure their needs are met.

**Sales and Marketing:** The primary responsibility of a Banquet Sales Executive is to sell banquet and event spaces to potential clients. This involves identifying and prospecting new clients, following up on leads, conducting site tours, and presenting proposals to clients that highlight the venue's features, amenities, and services.

This includes understanding the client's needs, creating event proposals, coordinating with other departments (such as catering, audio-visual, and housekeeping), and ensuring that all details are executed smoothly.

**Client Relationship Management:** Building and maintaining relationships with clients is essential for repeat business and positive word-of-mouth referrals. Banquet Sales Executives often act as the main point of contact for clients, addressing their questions, concerns, and special requests throughout the planning process and during the event itself.

**Quality Assurance:** Ensuring the quality of service and guest satisfaction is paramount in the hospitality industry. Banquet executives monitor events closely, addressing any issues that arise promptly and proactively seeking feedback from clients and guests to continuously improve the overall experience.

**Vendor Management:** In addition to coordinating with internal departments, banquet executives often work with external vendors such as florists, decorators, and entertainment providers to fulfill client requests and enhance the event experience.

**Compliance and Safety:** Banquet Sales Executives must ensure that all events comply with health, safety, and legal regulations. This includes adhering to food safety standards, fire codes, and other industry regulations to maintain a safe and secure environment for guests and staff.

**Networking and Relationship Building:** Building a strong network of industry contacts is essential for Banquet Sales Executives to generate leads and referrals. They attend networking events, trade shows, and industry conferences to connect with potential clients, event planners, and other professionals in the hospitality and events industry.

As a Fortune 50 company with more than 400,000 team members worldwide, Target is an iconic brand and one of America's leading retailers.


Working at Target means the opportunity to help all families discover the joy of everyday life. Caring for our communities is woven into who we are, and we invest in the places we collectively live, work and play. We prioritize relationships, fuel and develop talent by creating growth opportunities, and succeed as one Target team. At our core, our purpose is ingrained in who we are, what we value, and how we work. It’s how we care, grow, and win together.

  

Target Merchandising is evolving at an incredible pace. We are constantly reimagining how this $106 billion retailer offers the innovative, guest-inspiring items that Target is known and loved for. Our goal is to deliver exceptional value, quality and style to elevate Target as the premier retailer in a competitive global marketplace. Through intelligent and progressive business strategies that make the most of Target’s resources and partnerships worldwide, Merchandising works across product categories to create a localized shopping experience online and in our 1800 stores. Are you a creative problem solver who loves to see your work translate into real results? Can you collaborate effectively, execute a plan efficiently and positively influence how Target chooses and presents the right product in the right place at the right price? If so, you will have success on one of our dynamic teams.  

  

A role in Planning means being in charge of the financials and forecasting for one of Target’s businesses. Here, you’ll conduct comparative analysis of holiday or other seasonal performance reports and provide the insights that inform the Inventory team’s work to ensure that product supports projected sales. Acting as the hub between Merchandising and Supply Chain, you will create a financial link between these two essential groups and have a voice in some of the most important decisions from a financial strategy standpoint.  

  

As a Merchandise Planner, you’ll provide in-season decision support, collaborate on assortment planning, recommend localization and channel strategies including cluster types and profiles, and lead demand forecasting. You’ll support the divisional strategy through your category expertise and partnerships with cross-functional teams and vendors. You will head up the open-to-buy process and decide on category-level investment and the financial validity of assortments. You will conduct root cause analysis for variation between supply and demand forecasts to support “chase-cancel” decisions and communicate implications to vendors. You’ll conduct scenario planning, build unit plans, and lead initial set planning and operationalization to optimize assortments. A large part of your role will be to interpret forecast results and conduct “what if?” analysis to guide your go-forward recommendations. You will validate the unit promo planning forecast, drive maintenance, risk analysis and decision-making by the Pricing & Promotion Center of Excellence. And you’ll run event forecast creation and flow, analyzing item lifecycles and driving recommendations on end-of-season management.  

  

Core responsibilities are described within this job description. Job duties may change at any time due to business needs.

* Four-year degree or equivalent experience
* 2-6 years of relevant experience
* 1+ years of Merchandising experience
* Strong strategic, financial, and analytical skills; can easily translate data from an array of sources into insights and recommendations
