* **YOU HAVE A PARTNERSHIP MINDSET.** Our team works together with multiple stakeholders to deliver projects that use secure technologies and processes to solve real business problems. Your team members and business partners will seek out your opinion on the focus and outcome you’re looking to achieve. You aren’t afraid to dig deep and ask the tough questions of our customers, company, and executive team.
* **YOU ARE INTERESTED IN DEVELOPING THE EMPLOYEES ON YOUR TEAM.** You should believe in what you’re doing and inspire others around you to be their best selves and achieve their goals.
* **YOU HAVE DEEP RESPECT FOR YOUR CRAFT.** We are dedicated to building security sustainably, not chasing the latest fad but understanding the best solution for the problem. You're always looking for more and better ways to bake security into everyday processes, and enthusiastic about sharing them with your team.
* **YOU ARE RESPECTFUL, EMPATHETIC, AND HUMBLE.** We want you to take your work seriously and be open to personal and professional growth. Successful security professionals show everyone respect and consideration.
