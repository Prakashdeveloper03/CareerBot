This ranges from code reviews, penetration tests, and architectural reviews on new features and existing code, in order to provide security education and guidance to the entire organization.



This position is not for someone who operates solely on scanner-based vulnerabilities.

At Okta we fully support externally publishing exciting new findings and will help you do it in the form of white papers, blog posts, and live presentations at conferences of your choice.



Job Duties and Responsibilities:


* Work closely with Engineering teams on Design Reviews for new features or major changes
* Audit code for security flaws and best practices
* Perform Penetration Tests on new features and on the platform as a whole
* Develop, implement, and communicate vulnerability mitigation strategies to development teams
* Work solo and collaboratively to deliver projects on a deadline
* Think like an attacker and solve complex problems with expertise and ingenuity
* Give security presentations and represent Okta in private or public venues

* Ability to conduct a manual Web Application Penetration Test using industry standard tools (ex: Burp Suite)
* Knowledge of modern web application components, architecture, and design principles
* Ability to explain vulnerability risks and remediation options to developers
* Beginner level coding ability in at least one scripting language (ex: Python, Bash)


 Desired skills and Abilities:


* Knowledge in current authentication and authorization protocols (OIDC, SAML)
* Experience in mobile device (Android and/or iOS) application penetration testing
* Experience with SAST, DAST, SCA, and fuzzing tools
* Knowledge in current cryptographic algorithms and techniques
* Experience in attacking network protocols and analyzing network traffic
* Experience writing proof of concept scripts to demonstrate vulnerability exploitation
