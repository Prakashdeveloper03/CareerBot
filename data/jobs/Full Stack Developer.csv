Our current preferred stack is Java with Spring Boot on the back-end and React and React Native for front-end. We also like GraphQL, NextJS, JPA, Liquibase, Tailwind, Ant Design and Material UI Kits, Typescript, Gradle, Sass, AWS and Docker. But we’re perpetually monitoring and exploring the technology landscape and have been known to dabble with PWA, Machine Learning, NoSQL and JamStack solutions on occasion. A deep curiosity and openness to new technologies and techniques is the only thing we tend not to change up.


You love taking (sometimes ambiguous!) client requirements and translating them into best-practice patterns. You can help less experienced developers find the right ways of doing things, and you are just as happy churning out deliverables yourself. You have great communication skills, good attention to detail and a strong sense of high-quality product.


High-quality to you means:

* well aligned to internal designs and to the client’s vision
* a clean and reliable user experience
* high levels of accessibility
* consistency both within the current project and with industry best practices
* highly testable and tested
* reusable to enable increased efficiency in the future
* maintainable both from a development perspective, and also from a client perspective


Our projects are centered around our teams. We do more than speak the Agile lingo, we strive for a truly agile culture. A background of working with Scrum or Kanban is a plus but what’s really most important is having experience and willingness to work in a highly collaborative team setting. An important part of our team focus involves being able to coordinate work with the rest of the team. A valuable skill is being able to identify large blocks of functionality from requirements and design artifacts and break them down into suitable features and tasks.


As much as you have an eye for detail, you have an eye on the future. Application development is constantly evolving so we’re looking for someone to bring some new skills and capabilities to our existing teams. Whether you have an opinion on some of the emerging light-weight headless CMSs or have A/B testing experience to bring a more data driven approach to decision making we value the unique perspectives you can bring to our existing teams.

 **> Our Why**


We strive for excellence in everything we do. We value wisdom, curiosity, and a sense of fun.


Our work is meaningful. From providing easier and better ways for citizens to access state government information and programs aiding in a more informed and better served populace, to keeping pets and animals safe through registration and welfare tracking, to making vaccines available to people most in need- our software often has a direct benefit to people we’ll never meet.


We are also very dedicated to the people within our organization. We are proud to be consistently named one of Maine’s ""Best Places to Work"".


The benefits that we offer include:

* 100% Paid health and dental benefits for employees
* Health Reimbursement Account (to minimize out of pocket costs)
* Flexible Spending and Dependent Care Accounts
* Company matching retirement plan
* Annual profit sharing
* Flexible scheduling
* Up to 25 days paid vacation
* Free parking (you will love Old Port parking)
* Friday happy hours

Full Stack Developer**

**What’s the story?** 

In India, there are more than 453+ million migrants. Less than 2% of this cohort uses mobile payments to send money home. While penetration of UPI and digital banking hit the ceiling, this invisible workforce that powers most of Bharat is still stuck in a cash economy and remains underbanked. **branchX is India's first neobank enabling empathetic banking for migrant communities.** Building banking that is meaningfully accessible to every aspiring Indian goes beyond the 9-5 bustle. If you are someone who derives fulfillment from purpose-led work with the ability to experiment, innovate, fail and iterate, branchX is the playground for you.

**Location: Bangalore**

**About Us:**

Launched in June 2020, branchX is India's first neo-banking solution, enabling empathetic banking for migrant communities. Our vision is to transform the way underbanked communities manage money with a ‘hand-holding grid’ aided by intelligent technologies. Headquartered in Navi-Mumbai, we are a 100+ member impact-driven team with offices in Noida, Bangalore, Kochi, Tamil Nadu, Kolkata and other locations.

**Where do you come into the picture?** 

A highly motivated and experienced Full Stack Developer who will produce scalable software solutions. The individual should be comfortable with both front-end and back-end coding languages, development frameworks, and third-party libraries.

**What would a day in your life @ branchX look like?** 

* Work with development teams and product managers to ideate software solutions
* Design client-side and server-side architecture
* Build the front-end of applications through appealing visual design
* Develop and manage well-functioning databases and applications
* Write effective APIs
* Test software to ensure responsiveness and efficiency
* Troubleshoot, debug and upgrade software
* Create security and data protection settings
* Build features and applications with a mobile responsive design
* Write technical documentation
* Work with data scientists and analysts to improve software

**Desirables:**

* Proven experience of 4-5 years as a Full Stack Developer.
* Should be excellent in Python and PHP.
* Experience developing desktop and mobile applications.
* Familiarity with common stacks
* Knowledge of multiple front-end languages and libraries (e.g. HTML/ CSS, JavaScript, XML, jQuery)
* Knowledge of multiple back-end languages (e.g. C#, Java, Python) and JavaScript frameworks (e.g. Angular, React, Node.js)
* Familiarity with databases (e.g. MySQL, MongoDB), web servers (e.g. Apache), and UI/UX design
* Excellent communication and teamwork skills.
* Organizational skills
* Degree in Computer Science, Statistics or a relevant field.

**What expertise & experiences would you need to have to play this kind of role?** 

A strong leader who can adapt to cross-functional teams that are responsible for the full software development life cycle, from conception to deployment.

**Core Value** 

‘Empathy’ as a term has become a buzzword. At branchX, we are constantly reimagining what empathy means in action. While we are finding new ways of translating empathy at work and on the ground, we do know that it goes beyond the extension of feeling 'something' for an individual. We are combining empathy and action to uplift underbanked communities. What does this mean for you? It means you’ll be part of co-creating products for the masses. Products that are meaningfully accessed by the underserved and will directly boost India’s economy in the long term. If indulging in blue-sky thinking, innovating, and iterating to create grassroots impact makes you tickle.
