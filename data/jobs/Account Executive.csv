Today, 80% of them in the US are individually owned and operated and we want to keep it that way. We provide our entrepreneurs the tools and expertise to operate with the scale of a large chain while remaining independent.


We are a well-funded Series A startup with many happy customers and are growing to help make more entrepreneurs. That’s where you come in.

**The Role**


We’re looking for an Inbound Account Executive who will help us match with qualified nurses and doctors seeking to start their own med spa. You will be responsible for understanding the unique needs of potential partners, showcasing the benefits of our solutions, and effectively closing deals to help them achieve their entrepreneurial dreams.


You will help grow Moxie into the dominant partner for successful Med Spas. Your goal will be to meet or exceed monthly close targets and contribute to the overall growth and success of Moxie.

**Our objectives for the role**

* Effectively manage the sales cycle, from initial pitch to proposal review and deal closure. Utilize HubSpot to track and document interactions and progress.
* Conduct thorough needs assessments to understand potential partners' goals, challenges, and requirements. Tailor your sales approach to present Moxie's solutions as the ideal fit for their specific needs.
* Develop a deep understanding of Moxie's offerings, including operational support, product, marketing and regulatory compliance, to effectively communicate value propositions to potential partners.
* Cultivate strong relationships with potential partners by providing exceptional customer service and demonstrating a genuine interest in their success. Act as a trusted advisor throughout the sales process. Act as an ambassador of our mission and our partnership model, even when a relationship does not close
* Work towards achieving and exceeding monthly sales targets, contributing to the overall growth and success of the company.

**What we’re looking for**

* Proven track record in consultative selling, preferably in aesthetics or SMB SaaS.

* You’re a strong negotiator who can overcome objections and influence providers to choose Moxie.
* You meet or exceed sales targets and achieve desired outcomes.

* You see feedback as a gift, love to be coached and implement and execute on the coaching you receive immediately.

**Why join us**

* Above all, we’re in this to empower small business owners to own and grow their businesses. If you succeed, Med Spas will remain the opportunity for independent owner-operators instead of being dominated by a small number of large chains. If that speaks to you, speak to us.
* We have much left to build. But given the market feedback we’re getting and our founding team’s company-building experience, we think we are writing the first chapters of a real success story.
* Experience building and scaling an Outbound function as we win. A role like this molds to its owner, but inevitably stretches and grows you as well.

------------------------


At Keep, we embarked on a mission started by a powerful question: Why hasn't the banking experience caught up with the rapid pace of technology?


This continues to fuel our passion for reshaping the Canadian fintech landscape. We provide businesses with a comprehensive suite of cross-border banking services, offering everything from credit cards to deposit accounts, currency conversions, and revenue financing.


With a team of seasoned global startup veterans with successful exits, Keep is committed to leading the charge as Canada's next-generation fintech institution. Backed by VCs in the fintech sector, we're racing ahead, expanding our reach and impact like never before.

**About the Role:**
-------------------


We are seeking a dynamic and results-driven Account Executive to join our sales team. The ideal candidate will be responsible for managing and growing a portfolio of clients, developing strong relationships, and driving revenue growth. This role requires a strategic thinker with excellent communication skills and a proven track record in sales.

* Identify new business opportunities, negotiate and close deals, focusing on B2B sales within the SMB segment.
* Develop and execute effective sales strategies to achieve revenue targets.
* Connect with key decision-makers in SMBs, understanding their pain points and presenting our solutions effectively.
* Build and maintain strong relationships with existing clients.
* Understand client needs and objectives to provide tailored solutions.
* Conduct market research to identify potential clients and understand their needs.
* Provide feedback to the team on market dynamics and customer preferences.
* Work closely with cross-functional teams, including marketing, customer support, and product development.

**Who You Are:**
----------------

* Proven experience in sales or account management, preferably in tech and B2B environment.
* Detail-oriented and highly organized, you excel in managing multiple tasks and priorities.
* Strong communication and negotiation skills.
* Proficiency in CRM software and sales tools.
* Results-oriented with a track record of meeting or exceeding sales targets.

* Embrace a fully inclusive and remote-friendly company culture that values diversity and work-life balance.
* Help us bring modern banking solutions to businesses, reshaping the banking experience for our customers.

**Why This Might Not Be a Good Fit:**
-------------------------------------

* If you're a stickler for a highly structured environment with constant hand-holding, you might find our culture of autonomy and trust a bit different.
* If you're more of a slow-and-steady-wins-the-race kind of person, our fast-paced, dynamic environment might be a bit of a rollercoaster.
* Given the nature of our industry and our rapid growth, ambiguity, and uncertainty are all part of the ride. If you prefer clear-cut structures or roles, you might find our dynamic environment a bit too adventurous.
* Collaboration is the heartbeat of Keep, and if you prefer to work in your own little bubble without engaging with the wider team, you might find our approach to teamwork a tad unconventional.

**What’s the Interview Process Like?**
--------------------------------------

* Initial People Screening to understand your experience and ensure a cultural fit.
* Get on a call with Molly, our Sales Lead
* Dive into an Exercise and Presentation, where you'll showcase your skills through a comprehensive project.
