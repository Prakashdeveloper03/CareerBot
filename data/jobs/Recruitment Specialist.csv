**Location Details/Description:** Remote, Land Resources Division


For more information about the Land Resources Division, please visit https://www.nps.gov/orgs/1860/index.htm

**Position Overview:** The Land Resources Division guides and supports the land acquisition program for the National Park Service (NPS). Since its inception in 1916, the NPS has served as the ultimate caretaker of America's most valuable natural and cultural resources, while providing for public use and enjoyment of those resources. Today, the National Park System totals more than 84 million acres, yet more than 2.6 million acres of privately owned lands remain within NPS boundaries. Acquisition of all privately owned land within a given park boundary is not always necessary and, in some cases, not feasible. However, many of these lands are important for visitor use and preservation of resources and have therefore been identified to be protected in fee or by scenic/conservation easement interest.


The Realty Specialist Member will research legal documents, including deeds, easements, rights of ways, and other agreements to determine legal interest of existing third-party right-of-way uses (e.g., power lines, water lines, etc.) that are held by external parties within National Park Service (NPS) units. The project requires detailed legal analysis, data entry, and coordination with fellow interns and Land Resources Division employees. The intern will participate in team meetings with the WASO Lands Right-of-Way Program team and will work closely with the WASO Lands Cartography team and Regional Right-of-Way Coordinators. The intern will utilize existing NPS systems and external resources to conduct research.


This individual placement is meant to facilitate professional development and promotes exposure to land management agencies and networking with professionals. This could include gaining experience in different conservation fields and shadowing different work groups.

**Schedule:** Monday-Friday, 8:00am - 5:00pm; may be flexible.

**Position Benefits**

**Living Allowance:** The ACE Member is expected to contribute ~40 hours/week and will receive a living allowance of $1,000/week to offset the costs of food and incidental expenses, dispersed bi-weekly.

**Direct Hire Authority:** This position is classified as a DHA (Direct Hiring Authority) Internship. DHA positions target exceptional, current upper-level undergraduate or graduate students that are interested in pursuing careers with the NPS. DHA positions will be rigorous internships that develop the participant's technical and creative thinking abilities, leadership skills, and problem-solving capabilities.


DHA applicants will be involved in publications and design projects and be required to deliver a presentation to park leadership. After successful completion of the internship and all DHA program requirements, and after graduation from the member's degree program, the member will be eligible to receive DHA non-competitive hiring eligibility.

**Public Land Corps Hiring Authority:** Members serving under this agreement may be eligible for a federal hiring authority upon completion of their term of service and 640 hours of service. If the duration of a PLC-eligible term is not long enough for Members to accrue 640 hours of service (~16 weeks), the total hours served at the completion of the term may be eligible to be combined with hours accrued from another PLC-eligible term to meet the 640 hours requirement. PLC projects also include specific eligibility requirements such as age and citizenship. Please contact ACE staff with questions about eligibility, or view general information online: https://www.usaconservation.org/epic/#eligibility-requirements.

**Professional Development Stipend:** The Build Up member will receive $1,000 of professional development funds that can be used for approved purposes.

**ORGANIZATIONAL CONTEXT**  

  

The United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) is the specialized agency of the United Nations that promotes industrial development for poverty reduction, inclusive globalization and environmental sustainability. The mission of UNIDO, as described in the Lima Declaration adopted at the fifteenth session of the UNIDO General Conference in 2013 as well as the Abu Dhabi Declaration adopted at the eighteenth session of UNIDO General Conference in 2019, is to promote and accelerate inclusive and sustainable industrial development (ISID) in Member States. The relevance of ISID as an integrated approach to all three pillars of sustainable development is recognized by the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the related Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which will frame United Nations and country efforts towards sustainable development. UNIDO’s mandate is fully recognized in SDG-9, which calls to “Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation”. The relevance of ISID, however, applies in greater or lesser extent to all SDGs. Accordingly, the Organization’s programmatic focus is structured in four strategic priorities: Creating shared prosperity; Advancing economic competitiveness; Safeguarding the environment; and Strengthening knowledge and institutions.  

  

Each of these programmatic fields of activity contains a number of individual programmes, which are implemented in a holistic manner to achieve effective outcomes and impacts through UNIDO’s four enabling functions: (i) technical cooperation; (ii) analytical and research functions and policy advisory services; (iii) normative functions and standards and quality-related activities; and (iv) convening and partnerships for knowledge transfer, networking and industrial cooperation. Such core functions are carried out in Divisions/Offices in its Headquarters, Regional Offices and Hubs and Country Offices.

  


The Directorate of Technical Cooperation and Sustainable Industrial Development (TCS), headed by a Managing Director, oversees the Organization's development of capacities for industrial development as well as industrial policy advice, statistics and research activities and the Organization's normative contribution to the Member States and global development community in achieving the SDGs. The Directorate also ensures the application of strategies and interventions for sustainable industrial development related to the Environment, Energy, SMEs, Competitiveness and Job creation, as well as Digitalization and Artificial Intelligence. Through coordination in-house and with Member States and industry stakeholders, it ensures that the services provided in these areas contribute toward effective and appropriate technical, business and policy solutions and are focused on results and on realizing any potential for scaling up and positioning UNIDO as a leading platform for industrial development in developing countries and global fora.

  


The Division of Montreal Protocol (MPD), where this position is based, delivers policy advice, technology and financial solutions, and technical training to Member States. This work is broad in nature, engulfing a multitude of industrial sectors and stakeholders, from governments and industries to employees and consumers. It is innovative in pioneering new technologies and approaches, to find the best-suited alternatives for companies, sectors and countries.

  


**PROJECT CONTEXT**

  

Industrial development plays an important role in China's economic growth, with industrialization continuing to be a key national strategy. China's sustainable development is determined by the ability to maintain a high level of industrial growth, meanwhile avoiding further deterioration of the environment and high emissions of greenhouse gases. The accelerated development of Chinese industrial energy-saving technologies can help other countries minimize negative environmental impacts, while also having positive economic and social benefits through the promotion and support of manufacturers and specific technologies.

  


Indonesia and Thailand have been selected as beneficiary of this project “South-South cooperation in the energy-saving and environmentally-friendly industry” (SAP 150240), aiming to accelerate technical exchange and technology transfer of selected technologies between China and Thailand, as well as China and Indonesia, to promote energy saving experiences of China and boost Green Development of International industry.

  

In Indonesia, the cement sector has been identified as having significant potential for high energy-savings. In addition, relevant Chinese enterprises already possess a high level of technical expertise in energy-saving applications in this sector, particularly in Waste Heat Recovery (WHR) systems, which provide an opportunity for knowledge sharing and technology transfer across the countries.

  

Based on potential and expertise, Indonesia has been selected to showcase WHR systems in the cement sector. The Indonesian market has shown a strong shift towards the adoption of energy efficiency and energy-saving measures in recent years in response to strong energy consumption laws for designated enterprises.

  


Indonesia boasts the second-largest cement industry in South-East Asia, growing significantly in the last five years; in 2015, the production capacity of 15 cement companies in Indonesia was around 63 million tons.

  

With the continuous development of industry in the countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the need for environmental protection remains a pertinent issue. Furthermore, developing countries continue to have relatively low levels of economic development and infrastructure weaknesses that cause inefficiencies to persist. In this context, there is significant potential for the cement industry of Indonesia to benefit from the more mature WHR systems in China through technical exchange and technology transfer.

  

The project will facilitate a technology and experience exchange between Chinese and Indonesian companies, while also supporting Indonesia in the development of its policy framework.

  

The project will be operationalized through two components:


* Component 1- South-South Cooperation and Promotion of the Energy Saving Industry;
* Component 2 - Policy and strategy research on Chinese energy saving industry under the framework of the One Belt One Road Strategy.

  




**FUNCTIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES**

  

The consultant will work under the overall supervision of the Project Manager based in UNIDO Headquarters in Vienna and in close collaboration with experts from the Center for International Economic and Technological Cooperation (CIETC) established under the Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT).

**What We Do, How We Do It**


Too often, companies use a piecemeal approach when it comes to screening drivers. They might use one vendor to help recruit. Another to screen. And still, another to address the complex world that is compliance. This approach is inefficient, expensive, and redundant. Not to mention, it makes it too easy for things to fall through the cracks.


At Foley, we've built a company that effortlessly manages these three areas under one roof: recruit, screen, comply. Thanks to powerful technology combined with our compliance expertise, we're able to deliver a comprehensive solution to our customers and, as a result, a better overall customer experience.


**Where We're Headed**


We're always developing new solutions to slay tomorrow's recruitment, screening, and compliance monsters.

**What It's Like to Work with Us**


Diving deep into a niche industry and becoming an expert . . .
