There is plenty of important work and plenty of good opportunities with organizations like that.



Motivated: You are self-motivated. You bring an enthusiasm to the team, and imbue a sense of passion that goes beyond clocking in and clocking out. This isn't about a fake or arbitrary ""pieces of flair"" mentality or lack of work-life balance! It is about being a part of the vision and feeling a part of reaching team goals.



A team-player: Oklo genuinely is a team. We aren't about taking credit for ourselves, and we aren't about pushing blame to others. We do incredible things because we work as a team.



An excellent communicator: We need a person who is not only technically competent but also a clear and upbeat communicator.



Creative: Being creative means that when things fall outside clear scopes or processes or problems arise without clear solutions, you are able to identify it as well as invent ways to solve a problem or fill a need without micromanagement. The successful person in this job will not only be creative, but also enjoy being creative and solving open-ended problems which may change day-by-day.



Detail-oriented: This focus is a big part of excellence, consistency, and quality. Excellent grammar and spelling matter for both good communication as well as the image of the company that we put forward.

They would have had positions or specific projects where they have gained an overall understanding and knowledge of common cost-effective means and industry standards in distributing power ranging from 138kV down to 480V systems.  

The ideal candidate has the intellectual curiosity to want to optimize the power distribution system to meet project objectives at the lowest cost, while also having the direct knowledge to inform decisions and be able to communicate to the VP and CEO of the company the drivers behind those decisions. Having positions or previous experiences in working up multiple options for different configurations of the overall power systems, with different costs and reliabilities, while also being able to develop and review purchase specifications for equipment within the system would be ideal.
Should that person also have some experience in an operating plant environment, which would help them be more successful as they could apply those experiences in this work to create stronger projects.
The ideal candidate is humbly confident in their knowledge and work, able to speak up and advocate for specific decisions in the project, while being flexible enough to internalize the needs and feedback from the project team in a gracious manner. The ideal candidate is willing to roll up their sleeves and support the team versus delegating everything to a contractor. The ideal candidate asks where they can help and finds alternatives when solving difficult problems supporting the team. They have experiences where they can show they have worked on larger multi-step projects requiring multiple individuals in a coordinated manner, but independent enough to not required day-to-day direction in their work.
