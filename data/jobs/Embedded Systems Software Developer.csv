Hedgehog is an open source software company dedicated to giving Cloud Native application owners the ability to deploy workloads on edge compute and distributed cloud infrastructure with the same procurement power and automated operations that power the public cloud. Hedgehog helps customers escape vendor lock, automate mass-scale infrastructure operations, and reduce their cost of service. Hedgehog is a member of the Open Compute Project, The Linux Foundation, and the SONiC community.

**Hedgehog Values**


Family


All for one and one for all! When you join Hedgehog you join a family. We are a community of friends who enjoy working together. We try really hard to understand each others values and discern whether our values are compatible. If they are, we treat each other with the love and respect we would treat a family member.


Trust


We need to know you can get the job. We need to know you have our backs. We trust that we can make each other successful. If we can’t trust each other, we can’t succeed.


Honesty


Transparency builds trust. We always strive to be as transparent, open and honest as possible. We aren’t passive aggressive, opaque or two-faced. We say what we mean and we mean what we say. That doesn’t mean that we are blunt, rude, or aggressive. It means that we are open with ourselves, our teammates, our partners and our customers. We’re in the business of open-source software after all. We should walk the walk when we talk the talk.


Fairness


Politics suck. Favoritism sucks even more. Be a good human. Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. Kick ass and you will be rewarded. Fail and we will help you succeed. Loose trust and we will let you know you need to have our backs.


Innovation


We take risk to join a community like Hedgehog because we want to build, market, sell and support a really great product that delivers incredible value for customers. We are in the tech business because we love the creative destruction of innovation. We love to disrupt the status quo, and we love to make people happy when they use our stuff.


Fun


Work should be fun. A lot of fun. We all want to love what we do. Life is short. It’s too short to not have fun doing what we do at least five days a week. Work can be hard at times, but we put in the effort because we feel satisfied with the results we achieve and the relationships we build. When we consistently feel that work is not fun, we introspect to understand why so we can get back to having fun again.


Care


As much as we want to make Hedgehog a family, we all obviously have actual families outside of work. Family comes first. If you need time, space or support to take care of your family and yourself, we go out of our way to give you what you need.

**Hedgehog Benefits**

* World class team
* Fun culture
* Engaging and interesting engineering problems
* Competitive salary
* Startup equity

As a global leader in cybersecurity, our team changed the game. Since our inception, our market leading cloud-native platform has offered unparalleled protection against the most sophisticated cyberattacks. We work on large scale distributed systems, processing over 1 trillion events a day with a petabyte of RAM deployed in our Cassandra clusters - and this traffic is growing daily. We’re looking for people with limitless passion, a relentless focus on innovation and a fanatical commitment to developing and shaping our cybersecurity platform. Consistently recognized as a top workplace, CrowdStrike is committed to cultivating an inclusive, remote-first culture that offers people the autonomy and flexibility to balance the needs of work and life while taking their career to the next level. Interested in working for a company that sets the standard and leads with integrity? Join us on a mission that matters - one team, one fight.
About the Role:
CrowdStrike is looking for a Senior Software Engineer to join our growing Content Research and Integration team within the EndPoint Protection Content group, which focuses on security related endpoint development on the Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms.
The Endpoint Protection Content group plays a central role in fulfilling CrowdStrike’s mission to *Stop Breaches*. Within the Content Research and Integration team (CRI), we develop innovative capabilities to detect suspicious or malicious behavior on customer endpoint devices. Our goal is to enable the sensor to autonomously identify and stop the bad guys where possible, and to provide useful visibility and guidance to security analysts when new previously unknown adversary activity occurs. We research attacker behavior to understand their tools and techniques, and we build the capabilities to detect and prevent their malicious activity. Our detection strategies are primarily performed directly on the endpoint, but can also execute in the cloud, and may also utilize a hybrid approach combining aspects of both environments. This ability to leverage a variety of tools across the CrowdStrike stack allow us to accomplish our detection goals while balancing local resource utilization and false positives for our customers.
As a sensor engineer within the CRI Windows team you will be focused on the research and development of sensor capabilities to provide visibility and detection support for attack techniques across supported Windows OS versions. You’ll work collaboratively to implement detection logic within the Falcon sensor which includes both user-mode and kernel-mode components that together observe system activity, recognize malicious behavior, provide on-box prevention and remediation capabilities, and send relevant security related telemetry to the Falcon Cloud. You’ll help find creative and resourceful ways to detect Windows specific threats while also helping to develop cross platform features that leverage telemetry from common OS subsystems such as file system, memory, process, and network activity. You’ll get exposure to both user-mode and kernel-mode coding practices.
As a Senior Engineer, you’ll function as a key resource and subject matter expert for other engineers within the team and across the group. You’ll collaborate with various other teams as you drive your own initiatives and assist with other projects. You’ll be expected to make significant contributions from the initial concept phase through design, implementation, release, and bugtail/support. We're looking for smart people who want to be challenged and take ownership of what they build.
What You'll Do:* Design and build detection logic and systems leveraged across teams within CrowdStrike to detect cyber attackers and stop breaches.
* Extend our existing codebase and test suites utilizing C++, Python, and other tools as appropriate.
* Brainstorm, define, and build collaboratively across multiple teams.
* Build elegant, robust, and reliable solutions for complex technical problems.
* Obsess about learning, and champion the newest technologies & tricks with others, raising the technical IQ of the team.
* Deliver and accept feedback with grace and courtesy.
* Troubleshoot issues within the product when necessary, assisting customer support.
* Leverage your understanding of engineering best practices, including topics like secure coding, testing paradigms, effective peer code reviews, logging, and resilient architecture patterns, to ensure that our code is clean.
* Be an energetic ‘self-starter’ who is empowered to take ownership and be accountable for deliverables, both individually and when leading a team.


What You'll Need:* 5+ years of experience designing, building, and delivering high-quality software in C/C++ with at least 2 years in security and/or kernel mode programming.
* Low-level OS knowledge of Windows operating system internals, components, APIs, and design.
* Team player – able to lead, mentor, communicate, collaborate, and work effectively in a globally distributed team.


Preferred Qualifications:* Prior security experience, particularly in exploit and vulnerability analysis.
* Prior experience working with low-level code, such as OS kernel, firmware or device drivers.
* Understanding of kernel-mode and multi-threaded concurrent systems development in any of our supported platforms, with an interest to grow skills in all of them.
* Prior development or testing experience with python.
* Prior experience delivering software via agile processes.
