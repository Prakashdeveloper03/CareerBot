The amount of returned or unsold inventory continues to grow each year, and in 2020, it was estimated at over $1 trillion worth worldwide. We know there is tremendous value in and demand for this inventory - no matter the category, condition, or location. The B-Stock platform gives buyers a simple way to buy brand-name merchandise directly from top retailers and manufacturers.

***Do The Hard Things Today That Will Pay Off Tomorrow***  

We're willing to sacrifice and endure, fail and adapt to reach our long-term goals.


***Use Trust As The Best Measure Of Success***  

The trust we earn along the way is more valuable than money. Without trust from both our buyers and sellers, our business won't succeed.


***Find Strength In Numbers***  

Use our passion for data to provide value to our customers, improve ourselves, and develop new ways to delight our buyers and sellers.
