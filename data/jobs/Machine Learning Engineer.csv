We refuse to be ordinary, so neither is this job description! At the core of our work is our belief that teachers hold the power to move educational outcomes forward. We want technical experts who not only care deeply about solving complex problems, but also about impact. It is our responsibility to include the people impacted during model design, consider human engagement risks, and protect our students. So if you’re down to push on how ML models can improve equity in education, let’s talk!

**What we’re looking for and why we need you!**


We are seeking an eager Machine Learning Engineer in our pursuit of bringing computer vision-language-enabled solutions to education. Too many AI solutions in education require students to sit on Chromebooks using a janky UX to interact with an AI chatbot. Not for our kids, thank you – to us, that’s a dystopia. We envision a world where students challenge each other through discussion, try hard at hard problems, and build core knowledge. For AI to have a role in the world we envision, the AI needs to be able to diagnose student work using optical sensors, freeing students from the constraints of the keyboard.


There’s no more natural gauge of whether you understand a math problem than working it out with nothing more than a question and a pencil. We’re working on a 3-year work study funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to collect a large sample of handwritten student work, hire math content experts to diagnose the work, and train an AI to replicate the expert diagnosis. We are looking to expand the capacity of our team of engineers to build models capable of making the nuanced distinction between correct and partially correct work that can handle image inputs that combine numbers, figures, and text. It’s a hard problem filled with exciting opportunities to push the state of the art. The goal is to build delightful products and experiences for millions of students, teachers, and families.  

  

***We’re looking for Machine Learning Engineers to join us as we build products that will give teachers the benefit of an AI co-pilot without requiring students to sit at Chromebooks.***

 **At EdLight, You Will:**

  

* Curate datasets to use in fine tuning multi-modal LLMs
* Experiment with adding multi-modal capabilities to open source LLMs to better understand where the challenges will be in training data at scale
* Laugh and play as part of a team that is tackling hard problems with humility
* Lead EdLight’s intern to complete projects with consideration of innovation and efficiency

 **You Are:**

  

* Completed Bachelor’s Degree in relevant field
* 3+ years of post-Bachelor’s credits in pursuit of an advanced decree in Computer Science or an applicable field
* Seeking experience that will make a positive difference in the world where you can apply your skills, learn and grow
* Passionate about educational equity and creating solutions that make quality instruction accessible for all
* Proficient in Python and object-oriented programming (OOP)
* Captivated by the applications of machine learning to handwritten student work
* Proficient in state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV)

We’re looking for a hungry, curious, self-motivated learner to join our team and help us fulfill our mission of doing for proteins what Illumina has done for DNA.


The role is very tactical and hands-on: you’ll be executing and reporting on all growth marketing experiments. This can mean anything from email marketing, copywriting, and webinar coordination to paid advertising, cold outreach, and A/B testing. If you love learning things, experimenting, and want to get your feet wet across a bunch of tools, this role is for you.


If you don’t have formal experience with the channels or tactics mentioned above, that’s OK; we work with the experts at Got Users to coach our internal team, and they provide playbooks and feedback on all the major growth experiments you’d run.

**What You’ll Be Doing**
========================

* Learning the nuts-and-bolts of how to get users: this includes copywriting, digital ads, conferences, writing landing pages, and much more.
* Interviewing users and listening to sales calls.
* Communicating the firsthand problems facing biologists aiming to leverage proteomics today, and how to help them solve those problems, at scale.

**About Us**
============


Nomic was founded with the purpose of making biology easier to measure. To do this, we have untangled some of the most difficult problems in protein profiling. Our team is combining DNA nanotechnology, high-dimensional flow cytometry, laboratory automation, and machine learning to develop the world’s highest throughput proteomic platform: the **nELISA**.


Since spinning out of McGill University, we have partnered with and provided platform access to dozens of drug discovery groups including GSK, 4 of the top 10 pharmas, and leading biotechs.


We have recently launched a state of the art manufacturing and protein profiling facilities that enable multiplexed measurement of >2.5M samples a year, generating an effective 500M protein assays in the process.


We are building a diverse team of engineers, scientists, and world-changers. We like to break down difficult problems using a first principles approach, often leveraging the latest breakthroughs from across the scientific and technological spectrum to drive our mission forward.

**About You**
=============


You don’t expect us to manage everything you do. You can quickly figure out new tools + platforms, proactively ask questions when things aren’t clear, and be a friendly face to our partners and customers.


You do need to deeply care about one thing: life science R+D teams. Maybe you were on one in grad school, maybe you’ve benefited from their findings, or maybe you just care about their contributions to humanity.


You’re excited to learn new practical skills and quickly level up your growth and marketing chops.

**Skills & Qualifications**
---------------------------

* A master’s degree in biochemistry, biology, experimental medicine, immunology, bioengineering, synthetic biology, or similar.
* 0-3 years of experience in marketing, business development, or similar roles.
* Clear, concise, writing skills. You can write informally, get to the point, and can generally follow these guidelines.
* A track record of building and executing on projects. (Grad school projects/research count.)
* Comfortable learning new tech on your own: it’s a good sign if you Google things you don’t know, use ChatGPT, and have used no-code tools like Zapier, Airtable, or Notion before.
* Comfortable with basic mental math.


	+ If we said an ad got 20,000 clicks, 1% of those clicks turned into signups, and 20% of those converted into customers, you’d be able to tell us how many customers we got.
* Entrepreneurial: You’re excited about joining a small, high-growth team and contributing across all areas of marketing.
* No ego: There’s a lot we wish we could do but don’t have time for. Must have the ability to put the most urgent priorities first, even if they aren’t glamorous.
* Experience doing some kind of marketing is a plus, even if it’s for a student group or a family member’s business.

Why do we feel this way? We embrace the belief that by providing the best service possible to the government, we ultimately provide the best service to our nation.

Our SaaS platform uses WiFi, advanced AI, and machine learning to create the future of connected spaces—and human experiences—at massive scale.



We now deliver services to over 50 million locations globally and have managed over 2.5 billion devices on our platform. We're expanding rapidly, pioneering a new category, and we achieved our Series F funding in just four years. Our customers include many of the world's largest Communications Service Providers (CSPs) who look to Plume to help them evolve their smart home offerings while gleaning insights from their own data.



With a bias for action and a love for being trailblazers, the team at Plume embodies a combination of relentless curiosity and imaginative innovation. We challenge ourselves to think in ways that other companies don't, work to do what should be done (rather than what can), and if we can't do it exceptionally well, we don't do it.

That's what makes our novel behavioral-based approach so…*Abnormal.* Abnormal has constantly been named as one of the top cybersecurity startups and our behavioral AI system has helped us win various cybersecurity accolades resulting in being trusted to protect more than 8% of the Fortune 1000 ( and ever growing ).



In a landscape where a single successful attack can lead to financial losses of millions of dollars, the Attack Detection team plays the central role of building an extremely high recall Detection Engine that can operate on hundreds of millions of messages at milliseconds latency. The Attack Detection team's mission statement is to provide world-class detector efficacy to tackle changing attack landscape using a combination of generalizable and auto trained models as well as specific detectors for high value attack categories.



This team is solving a multi-layered detection problem, which involves modeling communication patterns to establish enterprise-wide baselines, incorporating these patterns as robust signals, and combining these signals with contextual information to create extremely precise systems. The team builds discriminative signals at various levels including message level (eg. presence of particular phrases), sender-level (eg.frequency of sender) and recipient level (eg.likelihood of receiving a safe message). These signals are then combined and utilized to train highly accurate model based as well as heuristic detectors. Additionally, to continuously adapt to new unseen attacks, the team builds out different stages in our automated model retraining pipelines including data analytics and generation stages, modeling stages, production evaluation stages as well as automated deployment stages.



This role would also have an opportunity to have a significant impact on the overall charter, direction and roadmap of the team. The Machine Learning Engineer would be involved in understanding the domain of false negatives i.e. the current and future attacks which can cause significant customer workflow disruption. They would help define the technical roadmap required to address the most pressing customer problems and simultaneously operate our detection decisioning system at an extremely high recall.


**What you will do**
--------------------


* Design and implement systems that combine rules, models, feature engineering, and business and product inputs into an email detection product, with senior engineer guidance.
* Understand features that distinguish safe emails from email attacks, and how our model stack enables us to catch them.
* Identify and recommend new features groups or ML model approaches that can significantly improve detection efficacy for a product. Work with infrastructure & systems engineers to productionize signals to feed into the detection system.
* Writes code with testability, readability, edge cases, and errors in mind.
* Train models on well-defined datasets to improve model efficacy on specialized attacks
* Actively monitor and improve FN rates and efficacy rates for our message detection product attack categories, through feature engineering, rules and ML modeling.
* Analyze FN and FP datasets to categorize capability gaps and recommend short term feature and rule ideas to improve our detection efficacy.
* Contribute in other areas of the stack: building and debugging data pipelines, or presenting results back to customers in our tools when the occasion arises

**Must Haves**
--------------


* 3+ years experience designing, building and deploying machine learning applications in one of the domains of text understanding, entity recognition, NLP experience, computer vision, recommendation systems, or search.

1+ years of experience with writing stable and production level pipelines for model training and evaluation leading to reproducible models and metrics.  
* 
* Experience with data analytics and wielding SQL+pandas+spark framework to both build data and metric generation pipelines, and answer critical questions about system efficacy or counterfactual treatments.
* Ability to understand business requirements thoroughly and bias toward designing a simplest yet generalizable ML model / system that can accomplish the goal.

Uses a systematic approach to debug both data and system issues within ML / heuristics models.  
* 

Fluent with Python and machine learning toolkits like numpy, sklearn, pytorch and tensorflow.  
* 
* Effective software engineering skills who can find answers quickly from code base and writes structured, readable, well tested and efficient code.
* BS degree in Computer Science, Applied Sciences, Information Systems or other related engineering field

**Nice to Have**
----------------


* MS degree in Computer Science, Electrical Engineering or other related engineering field
* Experience with big data, statistics and Machine Learning
* Experience with algorithms and optimization


**This position is not:**


* A role focused on optimizing existing machine learning models
* A research-oriented role that's two-steps removed from the product or customer
* A statistics/data science meets ML role

------------------


Nooks is a platform **transforming sales reps from manual laborers to scientists**. With today's technology, sales reps shouldn't need to manually write hundreds of emails, research hundreds of websites/linkedins, and make hundreds of calls. They should instead **focus on the parts of their job that actually require people** - talking to customers, being creative, and problem-solving. With a combination of AI tools, automation and real-time collaboration, Nooks can do the rest.


**About Nooks**
---------------


* **The team:** Nooks is ~30 people. Engineering & product are mostly in SF and go to our office 2-3x/week. The go-to-market team is distributed across the U.S.
	+ The founders (Dan, Rohan, and Nikhil) met studying AI at Stanford, have published in top AI journals, Forbes 30u30, worked at Scale AI, Tesla Autopilot, etc.
	+ The engineering team has won international math & physics olympiads, has experience at Google, Facebook, Slack, Quora, Scale AI, Bolt, Snap, Flexport, and other fast-growing startups.
	+ The sales team have been top-performers at companies like Gong, Amplitude, LeadIQ, and Orum.
* **Fundraising:** we've raised ~$20M in venture capital from top-tier investors. $15M in a recent (un-announced) Series A
* **Fast growth:** in 16 months (since June ‘22) we've grown $0 $2.5M ARR. So far in 2023 we've grown over 3x and expect to 4x by EOY.


**The problem**
---------------


Sales pipeline is critical for growing companies. Many, especially B2B companies, have teams of sales/business development representatives (SDR/BDRs) or full-cycle account executives whose responsibility is to identify, contact, and qualify new potential customers. There are ~750,000 SDR/BDR's in the US alone (e.g. Airtable (https://boards.greenhouse.io/airtable/jobs/6744435002), Brex (https://www.brex.com/careers/6850017002), Databricks (https://www.databricks.com/company/careers/sales-development/business-development-representative-6933516002) and many other tech companies have sizable SDR/BDR teams)


In their day-to-day, SDR/BDRs spend time on 3 main activities:


* Prospecting & research - identify a list of potential customers using signals like industry, size, fundraising, headcount growth, new hires, job descriptions, etc.
* Email & LinkedIn messaging - write messages to those contacts to convey the problem and pitch your product. The goal is for them to book a demo
* Calling - Live phone conversations often have higher conversion than emails because they're more personal, but there's a lot more manual work involved


### ***Most of the sales rep's job can be automated with today's technology: large language models, web scraping, automation, integrations, etc.***


**Nooks today**
---------------

  

Our customers use Nooks for most of their day (avg ~3hrs/business day). Nooks currently owns end-to-end workflows around sales calls:


* AI dialer - automates the manual parts of the calling process: skipping answering machines, leaving voicemails, taking notes, logging calls, even figuring out what to say on a call
* Analytics - we record, transcribe, and analyze every call. Since these are all outbound calls with little context, these calls follow similar structure - opener, pitch, questions/objections, ask for meeting, etc. So we can answer questions like: “which reps struggle to book the meeting with prospects who showed interest” or “what are the most common objections across each of our key personas”
* Salesfloor - sales reps & managers can work together throughout the day, listen to each others' calls, give real-time advice, coaching, shadowing, onboarding, training.


Teams that use Nooks often see a 2-3x increase in reps' productivity within weeks! And we're working on adding prospecting / research workflows (to-be-announced soon!)


(https://app.nooks.in/demoroom)


### **The role**


Note: Exact job title will be commensurate with experience


We have an ambitious product vision in a nascent area - AI-powered realtime collaboration - so there are a ton of interesting technical challenges on our roadmap. We're hiring our first Machine Learning Engineer. This is a role focused on implementing ML features into Nooks. Our ideal candidate will have prior experience working in industry for a business where ML is a core part of the offering.


Responsibilities will include training production models to improve their accuracy for specific sales use cases. You will align our technical strategy with performance, cost and feasibility considerations.


### **Examples of engineering problems you may touch**


### ***These are just examples, this list is non-exhaustive, and you definitely don't need experience in all of these areas. But hopefully you find some of them exciting!***


* **Realtime audio AI & precision/recall/latency tradeoffs (algorithms & models)**
	+ We use audio data, transcription, silence detection, and several other signals to detect whether a live phone call is a voicemail, a human, or a dial tree. Here, latency is a third factor added to the standard precision/recall tradeoff because it's important we can detect humans quickly. Our approach involves LLM embeddings, few-shot learning, data labeling, and continuous monitoring of model performance in prod.
* **Smart call funnels & playbooks (data wrangling, backend eng, GPT-3, UX)**
	+ At what point in the conversation do my reps get stuck? What are the toughest questions that we need to address? Can I “program” a playbook so that Nooks will help my team standardize toward best-practices? We're using GPT-3 and other LLM's to turn companies' mostly unstructured call data into actionable strategies & feedback loops.
* **Conversation embeddings & markov models (ML modeling)**
	+ What does the anatomy of a call look like? If I say XYZ, what are the different ways the prospect might answer and the probabilities of each? Conditioned on the first half of the call, what do I say next to maximize the likelihood that I book a demo at the end of the call? Can we use LLM's to generate embeddings of conversations that we can use to cluster similar conversation patterns and predict where the conversation is headed?


**Requirements**
----------------


* Bachelor's or Master's degree in Computer Science, Machine Learning, Data Science, or a related field.
* 3+ years of industry experience, including 2+ years training and deploying ML models in production.
* Full stack ML Eng chops: proficiency in general purposes programming languages such as Python/Javascript, and with libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, scikit-learn etc.
* Expertise in areas like NLP, Deep Learning, Anomaly Detection, Transformers and Large Language Models.


Nice to haves:


* Background in an analytical field like heuristics, data science &/or statistics
* Prior experiences working in both startup and research environments


We offer competitive compensation because we want to hire the best people and reward them for their contributions to our mission. We pay all employees competitively relative to market. In compliance with pay transparency laws and in pursuit of pay equity and fairness, we publish salary ranges for our open roles. The target salary range for this role is $140,000 - $240,000. On top of base salary, we also offer equity, generous perks and comprehensive benefits."
