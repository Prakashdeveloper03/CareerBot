**About Fringe**
----------------


We built Fringe to give companies a better way to show love and care to their people. Because we believe it's the people who really matter.


Companies exist because of the products and services they offer, but we believe the people within them should come first. At Fringe, this is the way we live.


Practically this means we hire people who care about their teammates just as much as (if not more than) themselves. We hire people who are genuine, humble, willing to learn, ready to teach, able to adapt, flex, collaborate, celebrate each other, win together and lose together.


We're a startup, and that means we must be a courageous group. We solve problems all day, but we also mess up sometimes. We extend grace to each other, and we try again. We aren't looking for perfect people. We're looking for people who own their faults, play to their strengths, and have the courage to simply be the same person all the time.


If that doesn't sound like your cup of cold brew, no hard feelings. But that's exactly who we are and what you can expect when you work at Fringe.


Still interested? We'd love for you to apply."

=================


At Quilter, we are helping electrical engineers save time and accomplish more by automating the tedious and time-consuming task of designing circuit boards. Our team is composed of experts in electrical engineering, ML/AI, and software development leveraging (and inventing) novel techniques to solve the decades-old problem of automating circuit board design.


Created in 2021, Quilter has been fully remote from the start with team members distributed throughout the US and an unofficial ""headquarters"" in Los Angeles, CA. No matter where we come from, we're united by a common vision for the future and a core set of values we think will get us there:

* Focus on the mission
* Demonstrate grit
* Never stop learning
* Pursue excellence

**Job description**
===================


Quilter is hiring a Senior Devops Infrastructure Engineer to join our team.


Keeping Quilter running and improving is a significant infrastructure challenge. Generating PCB designs requires managing a cluster capable of assigning multiple GPUs and hundreds of CPU cores to each task. To keep our engineers developing swiftly, we run a large amount of such jobs in end to end regression and performance testing. Furthermore, training breakthrough models requires managing it's own set of infrastructure and data management.


This role is an opportunity to own the workflows and infrastructure for this entire system. It is the heartbeat of Quilter, and we are looking for experienced and driven engineers who are excited for the challenge.

**Requirements:**
=================

* Experience with managing Kubernetes clusters using infrastructure as code (ideally Terraform)
* You have experience with python, react + typescript, and ideally some C++/CUDA
* You know how to empathize with development teams, understand the pain points in their workflows and create tools to accelerate them

**What you'll do**
==================


You will be personally responsible for managing all of the following:

* Git workflows / deployments / unit testing
* Customer support workflows and instrumentation - driving down issue response time
* Infrastructure deployments, be it new releases or the creation of new development workspaces
* ML ops

**Please note**: We are an equal opportunity employer and currently a remote-only company. At this time, we are focused on hiring primarily within the US, with occasional exception to accommodate exceptional talent.

**What we offer:**
==================

* Interesting and challenging work
* Competitive salary and equity benefits
* Remote work with no commute
* Health, dental, and vision insurance
* Regular team events and offsites (~2x / year)
* Unlimited paid time off
* Paid parental leave

**Keywords:**


DevOps, Linux, Ubuntu, Jenkins, Python, Bash, Chef, GitHub, Docker, Kubernetes

**Minimum Qualifications:**


The primary role of the recruiting team is to develop, test, deliver, maintain, upgrade and support internal test infrastructure within Qualcomm’s Connectivity & Networking Business Unit. The team plays a vital role in the introduction of new products by providing infrastructure which enables their development from first pre-production samples through to mass production.  

  

The role of a DevOps Engineer involves working with technology experts to pull together all the elements that make up a test infrastructure ( hardware, software, drivers, test frameworks, etc) to build working, reliable, manageable and extensible deliverables. This involves participating in design discussions, developing test solutions for the team’s deliverables, and actively working on streamlining the development-test-deployment process.
  

  

In addition to the above, solutions need to be rolled out and managed globally. This includes building and maintaining servers, tools, and services, such as:  

network OS deployment solutions ( PXE ), monitoring solutions ( Prometheus and Grafana ), configuration management ( Chef ) and process automation ( Jenkins ).
  

  

Another important aspect is customer support ( internal customers ). When a deliverable is rolled out, the customers will typically integrate this into their test environment and create scripts to configure and manage the test runs. During this period test system integration support is required. Ongoing support is also provided for the life of the test solution.
  

  

This is a unique role with opportunities to do software development, test development as well as DevOps. The successful candidate is also expected to be a key contributor to system architecting and testing of new infrastructure solutions.**Applicants**: If you need an accommodation, during the application/hiring process, you may request an accommodation by sending email to accommodationsupport
