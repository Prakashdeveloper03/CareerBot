Uplevel Health is developing Uplevel RCM, an AI-powered solution that assists healthcare practices in reducing denials, automatically submitting appeals, managing prior auth, and improving collections.

Our long-term ambition is to leverage LLMs to fully automate a clinic's billing operations end-to-end so that we can not only drive better revenue outcomes for clinics, but also help elevate medical billers from performing menial tasks to higher level strategic thinking roles. We believe our technology is part of the way there already.

**An Exemplary Team**

We have a world-class team, bringing together AI product leaders from top tier companies like Google who've developed revenue intelligence products unlocking $300M+, medical advisors from Stanford & Mount Sinai, and technology experts from the fastest growing RCM companies in history.

**About This Role**

We're looking for an experienced RCM Specialist / Medical Biller to join our team in a part-time (contractor) position. The role is meant to be started first in an advisory capacity to our product team (1-2 hours per week), so it doesn't require leaving your current job. This initial phase of the role can also be used to assess whether this position is the right fit for you. After a few weeks, you'll then have the option to convert the role into a part-time (15-20 hours per week) or full-time (40 hours per week) position based on your personal preference.

We're looking for a candidate who's driven, eager to work in a fast-paced environment, and ready to be a strategic advisor & partner as we build this business together.

**Role Responsibilities**

This role is different from traditional RCM roles and comes with several unique benefits & responsibilities. As opposed to only carrying out traditional medical billing operations, you'll have the opportunity to:

* Oversee billing operations (in a management role) for healthcare practices.
* Provide RCM strategy advice to client clinics.
* Advise/influence our team of engineers in building the product.
* Receive a revenue share for clients you support.
* Help acquire new clients.
* Assist in hiring additional medical billers.
* Work remotely with flexible hours.

Note that while this is not a sales position, 1 of the responsibilities of the position is to help acquire new clients. This will only be about 25% of your time in this role.

**Compensation**

Please note that this is not a typical salaried position, it is based on a revenue sharing model and is meant to be pursued part-time (with the possibility of converting to full-time in the future). The salary listed on this job posting may not be accurate. We estimate that the income you earn will be greater than the salary range listed on this position, but please ask us for more details during your interview.

**Current Stage**

Uplevel RCM is under development and will be launching later this year to partner clinics. We're currently focusing on setting up our RCM Partner program by bringing on RCM Specialists / Medical Billers. By joining at this stage, you'll have the opportunity to learn & grow with the company, influence key decisions in formative stages of building a groundbreaking product, and share in greater financial upside as the company grows rapidly.

**Qualifications**

* Bachelor’s degree, preferably in a health-related profession or combination of applicable experience and education
* Prior experience as medical biller / RCM specialist.
* Experience in denial management, collections, and/or appeals.
* Experience in managing AR.
* Experience in claims factoring.
* Experience in CCM, PCM, PIN, and/or BHI programs is a plus.
* Excellent communication, interpersonal, and provider education skills
* Comfortable using EHR/telehealth software, MS Office, and learning new technologies

We are a leading Australian SEO agency looking for a talented SEO Specialist to join our team on a full-time basis. The successful candidate will be responsible for managing clients' websites, and improving organic rankings through SEO. The emphasis of this role is knowing WHAT to do, not just HOW to do it.

You will not have many clients, but the expectation is that work is done exceptionally well as there will be ample time to make SEO decisions. You will start with about 5 clients, but will never have more than 10. This is not a client facing role, which means that you will never directly communicate with clients. However, this means that you must be on top of the campaigns at all times and proactively make SEO magic happen. Reporting will be done to the director once per week, and a log should be maintained for all SEO actions (so you must be organised). You MUST have at least 2 years of experience in a similar role.
