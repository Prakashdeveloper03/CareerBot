Our client is looking for an Engineering Manager to add to their team near
Columbus, OH. You will oversee their engineering team (3) and R&D from each
project's discovery phase up to each product's delivery to production. Your
team will be designing customized electronic solutions for vehicles,
industrial, and marine applications. This is an exciting time for our client
as vehicles move more towards hybrid and EV. Because the solutions they design
are so niche, there isn't as much competition in the marketplace so you can
feel **secure** about making this move. What's even better is the control they
have over their work. They own their building and production making everything
in their job shop. You'll have the **flexibility** you don't often see since
they're not relying on contract manufacturing. You'd be a perfect fit if you
enjoy working with smaller companies and believe in that player/coach
leadership style. Someone who values communication and prides themselves on
their ability to build and mend bridges while still being a hands-on
contributor. You will be taking over engineering from one of their partners
who will be retiring within the next year. So, you'll have the best of both
worlds - the mentorship of an industry veteran who wants to hand over the keys
and the **autonomy** to help scale up their team to account for new business
growth. If you enjoy being an active contributor while still having
your**fingerprints on larger strategic initiatives** , this is the perfect
opportunity for you to have more impact without compromising your work/life
balance.

**Hardware Engineering Manager (electrical hardware design req.)
Responsibilities**

• Manage a team of engineers (3) and drive scaling-up efforts  
• Partner cross-functionally during the product design phase  
• Attend sales calls, scope projects, and evaluate project viability  
• Delegate assignments while personally owning some projects from concept to
production  
• Develop review process, lead status meetings, and drive results  
• Oversee pre-production and prototype builds  
• Suggest core technology improvements and maintain industry awareness  
• Act as a visionary for R&D initiatives including the evaluation of old
designs  
• Create and maintain relationships with key OEM contacts  
• Identify continuous improvement opportunities across processes and personnel  
• Pursue development opportunities and nurture a culture of innovation  
• Set and monitor expectations while providing the team with appropriate
mentorship

**Hardware Engineering Manager (electrical hardware design req.)
Qualifications**

• Bachelor's degree in electrical engineering required  
• New product development and R&D experience within electronic manufacturing
required  
• Previous hands-on experience with software programming required  
• Strong hardware design background required
