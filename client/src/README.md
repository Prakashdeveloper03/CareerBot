  - title: Supervised Learning
    details: Supervised learning involves training a model on a labeled dataset, where each example is associated with a target label. The model learns to make predictions by generalizing from the labeled examples.
  - title: Unsupervised Learning
    details: Unsupervised learning aims to uncover hidden patterns or structures in unlabeled data. Algorithms in this category cluster similar data points together or reduce the dimensionality of the data to reveal its underlying structure.
  - title: Reinforcement Learning
    details: Reinforcement learning involves an agent learning to interact with an environment to achieve a goal. The agent receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties based on its actions, allowing it to learn optimal strategies through trial and error.

- header: Deep Learning (DL)
  description: Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that focuses on neural networks with multiple layers (deep neural networks). It enables computers to learn complex patterns and representations from data, leading to state-of-the-art performance in various tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition.

  highlights:
  - title: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
    details: CNNs are widely used for tasks such as image classification, object detection, and image segmentation. They consist of convolutional layers that automatically learn hierarchical representations from image data.
  - title: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
    details: RNNs are designed to handle sequential data by maintaining a hidden state that captures temporal dependencies. They are commonly used for tasks such as text generation, machine translation, and time series prediction.
  - title: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
    details: GANs are a class of deep learning models that learn to generate new data samples that resemble a given dataset. They consist of two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, which are trained adversarially to produce realistic outputs.
- header: Natural Language Processing (NLP)
  description: Natural language processing focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. It involves a range of techniques and algorithms for tasks such as sentiment analysis, language translation, named entity recognition, and text summarization.

  - title: Tokenization
    details: Tokenization is the process of breaking down text into smaller units, such as words or subwords, for further analysis. It serves as the first step in many NLP tasks.
  - title: Word Embeddings
    details: Word embeddings are dense vector representations of words in a high-dimensional space. They capture semantic relationships between words and are used as input features for various NLP models.
  - title: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
    details: RNNs and LSTMs are commonly used for sequential data processing in NLP tasks. They can capture contextual information and dependencies in text data, making them suitable for tasks such as language modeling and sequence labeling.
- header: Recommendation Systems
  description: Recommendation systems aim to predict user preferences or interests and provide personalized recommendations for items such as products, movies, music, or articles. They leverage techniques such as collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and matrix factorization to generate recommendations.

  highlights:
  - title: Collaborative Filtering
    details: Collaborative filtering recommends items to users based on their past interactions and similarities with other users. It can be memory-based (user-item interactions) or model-based (matrix factorization).
  - title: Content-Based Filtering
    details: Content-based filtering recommends items to users based on the features or attributes of the items and the user's preferences. It focuses on the similarity between items and the user's profile.
  - title: Hybrid Recommendation Systems
    details: Hybrid recommendation systems combine multiple recommendation techniques to improve recommendation quality. They leverage both collaborative filtering and content-based filtering approaches to generate more accurate and diverse recommendations.
- header: Chatbot Building
  description: Chatbots are conversational agents that interact with users in natural language. They can answer questions, provide recommendations, assist with tasks, and simulate human-like conversations. Building chatbots involves natural language understanding, dialogue management, and natural language generation.

  - title: Natural Language Understanding (NLU)
    details: NLU enables chatbots to understand user inputs and extract relevant information. It involves tasks such as intent classification, entity recognition, and sentiment analysis.
  - title: Dialogue Management
    details: Dialogue management governs the flow of conversation between the user and the chatbot. It determines the appropriate responses based on the current dialogue context and user inputs.
  - title: Natural Language Generation (NLG)
    details: NLG enables chatbots to generate human-like responses in natural language. It involves tasks such as text generation, paraphrasing, and response optimization.
