### Core Concepts

Now, let's dive into the core concepts of Dialogflow and explore how you can leverage its features to build powerful and interactive conversational interfaces.

#### 1. Intents

Intents represent the user's intention or goal when interacting with a chatbot. Dialogflow uses machine learning to match user input to the appropriate intent and trigger the corresponding response.

#### 2. Entities

Entities represent important pieces of information extracted from user input, such as names, dates, locations, and more. Dialogflow uses entities to understand and process user input more accurately.

#### 3. Contexts

Contexts provide additional context for interpreting user input and generating responses. Dialogflow uses contexts to maintain stateful conversations and handle follow-up intents more effectively.

#### 4. Fulfillment

Fulfillment allows you to extend Dialogflow's capabilities by connecting it to backend services or external APIs. Dialogflow uses fulfillment to generate dynamic responses and perform actions based on user input.
